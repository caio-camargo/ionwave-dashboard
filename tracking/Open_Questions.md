## 🔴 CRITICAL (Blocks Multiple Work Streams)

### Q9: Positioning-Economics Tension - How to Reconcile?

**Status:** ACTIVE - needs strategic decision
**Discovered:** 2026-02-04 during market sizing analysis (Session #3)

**The Question:**
Marine plasma positioning appeals to a narrow segment, but the economics require drawing from the broader electrolyte market. How do we resolve this tension?

**Why It Matters:**
- Strategic coherence: positioning vs. market opportunity mismatch
- Messaging confusion: are we a marine plasma brand or an electrolyte brand?
- Customer acquisition: who do we target in ads?
- Blocks Product Strategy, Brand Messaging, Creative Strategy finalization
- May affect investor narrative clarity

**Current State:**
- **Positioning:** "Marine plasma #2 behind Seaonic" (narrow differentiation)
- **Market Reality:** Marine plasma DTC sachet segment = $300K-$1.5M/year (US)
- **Revenue Target:** $30K MRR Year 1 ($360K annual) = needs 24-120% of entire sub-segment
- **Economics Requirement:** Must draw from broader $1.5B US electrolyte sachet market to hit targets

**Evidence:**
- Marine Plasma Market Sizing analysis (v1.0.0): Seaonic revenue ~$100-180K/year
- 13+ marine plasma brands mapped, total segment estimated $300K-$1.5M/year
- $30K MRR requires ~500 monthly orders = 0.03% of broader electrolyte market (achievable)
- But 0.03% of narrow marine plasma segment = unrealistic concentration

**Options:**
1. **Accept the tension as "category creation within category":**
   - Position: Marine plasma differentiation (unique ingredient story)
   - Target: Broader electrolyte market (health-conscious, athletes, wellness)
   - Pitch: "Better electrolytes via marine plasma" not "Join marine plasma movement"
   - Pro: Honest, defensible, opens TAM
   - Con: Complex to explain, may dilute differentiation

2. **Pivot positioning to broader:**
   - Position: Premium electrolyte brand (marine plasma as ingredient differentiator)
   - Target: Electrolyte market directly (LMNT switchers, Liquid IV upgraders)
   - Pitch: "Clean electrolytes, ocean-sourced minerals"
   - Pro: Clearer TAM story, simpler messaging
   - Con: Loses "marine plasma expert" positioning

3. **Accept narrow thesis but lower revenue targets:**
   - Position: Stay narrow (marine plasma specialist)
   - Target: Dominate tiny segment (80%+ market share goal)
   - Pitch: "The marine plasma brand"
   - Pro: Clear differentiation, defensible niche
   - Con: Doesn't support $100K MRR economics, may not justify VC funding

4. **Pursue category expansion:**
   - Position: Marine plasma pioneer
   - Target: Grow the segment itself (education-heavy approach)
   - Pitch: Thought leadership, category creation content
   - Pro: Build moat via education
   - Con: Very expensive (content, PR, influencer ed), 2-5 year timeline

**Decision Needed By:** Before finalizing Product Strategy (File 05A), Brand Messaging (File 09)
**Owner:** Danilo + investor/advisor input
**Analysis Needed:** Unit economics modeling by segment (Track A); brand testing (Track B)
**Blocks:** Product Strategy, Brand Messaging, Creative Strategy, Investor Narrative

### Q10: Capital Sufficiency - Is $30-50K Raise Enough?

**Status:** ANALYZED - see Financial_Model_Revenue_Validation.md for full analysis
**Discovered:** 2026-02-04 during Porter's Five Forces persona dialogue (Round 6)
**Analyzed:** 2026-02-05 via comprehensive financial model

**The Question:**
Given structural market forces (rising CPMs, zero switching costs, category creation costs), is the planned $30-50K raise sufficient to reach sustainability?

**Why It Matters:**
- Undercapitalization = death spiral (can't spend enough to learn, can't iterate)
- Wrong raise size = wrong investor type (angel vs. seed vs. pre-seed)
- Affects runway, burn rate planning, milestone setting
- Blocks Fundraising strategy (File 20)
- May require rethinking entire ODD-1 thesis

**Current State:**
- **Planned Raise:** $30-50K (from ODD-1 Complete Thesis sheet)
- **Assumption:** Bootstrapped initial traction, raise for scale
- **Capital Tension:** Flagged in Assumptions Register but not quantified
- **No Financial Model:** File 08 not yet built/audited - can't validate sufficiency

**Evidence of Risk:**
- **Porter's Force 3:** Rising Meta CPMs ($15-40 → $60-120 over 3 years per LMNT lawsuit)
- **Porter's Force 4:** Zero switching costs = high CAC to overcome inertia
- **Porter's Force 5:** Category creation (if pursuing marine plasma positioning) = expensive education
- **Competitive Response:** LMNT has $66M revenue, can out-spend on customer acquisition
- **Survival Rate:** 90% of electrolyte brands fail - survivors have capital cushion

**Options:**
1. **Validate $30-50K is sufficient:**
   - Build File 08 (Financial Model) with conservative assumptions
   - Model: months of runway, customer acquisition cost, time to payback
   - If model shows path to sustainability → proceed with planned raise
   - Risk: Model assumptions may be too optimistic

2. **Raise more capital upfront ($100-150K):**
   - Longer runway to find product-market fit
   - Can afford to test/iterate on acquisition channels
   - Buffer against CAC inflation
   - Risk: Dilution, higher bar to prove traction

3. **Staged approach (raise $30-50K, plan for follow-on):**
   - Use initial capital to validate core assumptions
   - Line up follow-on capital trigger (e.g., $10K MRR milestone)
   - De-risk for next investors
   - Risk: May hit capital constraint before proving enough

4. **Bootstrapped start, raise only if traction:**
   - Minimize dilution
   - Prove demand before taking capital
   - Risk: Undercapitalized, slow growth, competitors move faster

**Decision Needed By:** Before starting fundraising conversations (File 20)
**Owner:** Danilo
**Analysis Needed:** CRITICAL - Build File 08 (Financial Model) to quantify capital needs
**Blocks:** Fundraising strategy, Planning & Roadmaps, Team hiring decisions
**Related:**
- data/01_strategic_foundation/assumptions_register.json (capital tension flagged)
- Porter_Five_Forces_Analysis.md (structural forces driving capital needs)
- Strategic_Foundation_Analysis.md (capital tension matrix)

### Q11: Financial Model Validation - What's the Path to $30K MRR?

**Status:** ANALYZED - see Financial_Model_Revenue_Validation.md for full analysis
**Discovered:** 2026-02-04 - carried from multiple session "Next Steps"
**Analyzed:** 2026-02-05 via month-by-month cohort model

**The Question:**
Can we actually achieve $30K MRR in Year 1 given market sizing findings, or do we need to revise targets?

**Why It Matters:**
- **Revenue target drives everything:** team size, capital needs, timeline, investor expectations
- **Credibility:** Unrealistic targets destroy investor confidence
- **Planning:** Can't build roadmap without validated revenue model
- **Unit economics:** Need to model by segment to see if positioning-economics tension is fatal
- Blocks Planning & Roadmaps (File 04), Fundraising (File 20), all execution work

**Current State:**
- **Target:** $30K MRR Year 1 (stated in Strategic Foundation)
- **Market Reality:** Marine plasma segment too small to support this alone
- **Assumption:** Can draw from broader electrolyte market
- **Math Check:** $30K MRR = ~500 monthly orders at $60 AOV with subscriptions
- **No Model:** File 08 (Financial Model) not yet audited - can't validate feasibility

**What We Need to Know:**
1. **Customer acquisition math:**
   - Estimated CAC by channel (paid social, influencer, organic)
   - Conversion rates (traffic → email → purchase → subscriber)
   - Payback period (months to recover CAC)
   - Can we afford to acquire 500 customers/month?

2. **Revenue buildup:**
   - Month-by-month growth (starting from 0)
   - What growth rate required? (10%/month? 20%?)
   - When do we hit $30K MRR milestone?
   - Is Year 1 realistic or should it be Year 2?

3. **Unit economics by segment:**
   - Marine plasma enthusiasts (narrow, high intent, low volume)
   - Electrolyte upgraders (broader, lower intent, high volume)
   - Do the economics work for both? Or do we need to pick one?

4. **Capital requirements:**
   - How much burn before hitting $30K MRR?
   - Does $30-50K raise cover it, or do we need more?

**Decision Needed By:** ASAP - blockers are piling up
**Owner:** Caio (build model) + Danilo (validate assumptions)
**How to Resolve:**
1. Audit existing File 08 (Financial Model) if it exists
2. Build from scratch if needed, using:
   - Unit Economics (File 06) - if exists and is quality
   - Market sizing data (Marine_Plasma_Market_Sizing.md)
   - Porter's analysis (CAC inflation context)
   - Industry benchmarks where data gaps exist
3. Model 3 scenarios: conservative, baseline, optimistic
4. Identify which assumptions are most critical to validate

**Blocks:** Everything downstream - Planning, Fundraising, Team, Operations

- Marine_Plasma_Market_Sizing.md (TAM context)
- Strategic_Foundation_Analysis.md (revenue target source)

### Q1: Target Gross Margin - Accept 40% or Find Path to 70%?

**Status:** ACTIVE - needs decision within 48 hours
**Discovered:** 2026-02-02 during bootstrap work  

**The Question:**
Should we accept 40% gross margin (based on actual supplier quotes) or pursue path to 70% (industry standard)?

**Why It Matters:**
- Blocks Unit Economics finalization
- Blocks Offer Strategy development  
- Blocks Financial Model projections
- Blocks Pricing decisions
- May affect W Formula viability score

**Current State:**
- Unit Economics assumes 70% margin (industry benchmark)
- Landed Cost analysis shows 40% margin (actual supplier data: $12 COGS at $59 retail)
- 30 percentage point gap creates cascade of issues

**Options:**
1. **Accept 40% margin:**
   - Adjust pricing strategy to work within constraint
   - May need higher price point or volume
   - More conservative, based on real data
   
2. **Pursue 70% margin:**
   - Negotiate COGS down to ~$8 (33% reduction needed)
   - Alternative supplier sourcing
   - May require formulation changes
   
3. **Hybrid approach:**
   - Increase price to $79-89 (improves margin at current COGS)
   - Test if market will bear higher price vs LMNT

**Decision Needed By:** 2026-02-04 (within 48 hours)  
**Owner:** Danilo  
**Supporting Analysis:** Caio to model all three scenarios  
**Blocks:** Unit Economics, Offer Strategy, Financial Model  
**Related:** Decision_Log.md #2026-02-02-001, Discrepancy_Register.md #D1

### Q2: Single SKU or Multiple Flavors at Launch?

**Status:** ASSUMPTION - needs validation  
**Discovered:** During unit economics review  

**The Question:**
Do we launch with single SKU (unflavored) or multiple flavor variants?

**Why It Matters:**
- Affects inventory planning (MOQ per SKU)
- Affects unit economics (split volume across SKUs)
- Affects creative strategy (how to present choice)
- Affects production complexity
- Affects cash requirements (inventory for multiple SKUs)

**Current Assumption:**
Single SKU (unflavored marine plasma) for simplicity

**Risk If Wrong:**
- Customers expect flavor options (like LMNT has 7+ flavors)
- Single flavor may limit appeal
- But multiple flavors increases complexity 3x-5x

**Options:**
1. **Single SKU launch:**
   - Simpler operations
   - Lower cash requirement
   - Easier to test market
   - Risk: May limit growth
   
2. **3-5 flavor launch:**
   - Broader appeal
   - Matches competitor expectations
   - Higher inventory requirement
   - More complex creative/messaging
   
3. **Launch single, add flavors in wave 2:**
   - Phased approach
   - Learn from initial sales
   - Add flavors based on feedback

**Decision Needed By:** Week 2 of Implementation Sprint  
**Owner:** Product team + Danilo  
**Blocks:** Production planning, creative strategy, inventory planning  
**Related:** Unit Economics (affects MOQ calculations)

## 🟡 HIGH (Affects Specific Areas Significantly)

### Q3: DTC-Only or Retail Partnership at Launch?

**Status:** ASSUMPTION - needs strategic decision  
**Discovered:** During channel strategy review  

**The Question:**
Launch DTC-only or include retail partnership from day one?

**Why It Matters:**
- Retail requires different pricing structure (wholesale vs DTC margin)
- Affects unit economics significantly
- Affects brand positioning
- Affects cash flow (retail = NET 60-90 payment terms)
- Affects packaging requirements

**Current Assumption:**
DTC-only for first 6-12 months

**Options:**
1. **DTC-only:**
   - Full margin capture
   - Direct customer relationship
   - Faster iteration
   - Simpler operations
   
2. **DTC + Selective Retail:**
   - Broader reach
   - Credibility from retail presence
   - Lower margins, slower cash
   - More complexity
   
3. **Retail-first:**
   - Leverage existing distribution
   - Less marketing spend required
   - Give up margin and customer data

**Decision Needed By:** Before finalizing Channel Strategy  
**Owner:** Danilo  
**Analysis Needed:** Model economics of each approach  
**Related:** Unit Economics, Channel Strategy, Financial Model

### Q4: Subscription Incentive - Discount % or Free Shipping?

**Status:** NEEDS TESTING  

**The Question:**
What subscription incentive drives highest LTV? Discount percentage or free shipping?

**Why It Matters:**
- Affects LTV calculations
- Affects margin per subscriber
- Affects churn rate
- Industry shows both work, need to test for IonWave

**Current Assumption:**
15% discount for subscribers (following LMNT model)

**Options:**
1. **% Discount (10-20%):**
   - Clear value proposition
   - Easy to communicate
   - Reduces revenue per order
   
2. **Free Shipping:**
   - No revenue impact (if AOV high enough)
   - Perceived value high
   - May be less compelling than discount
   
3. **Hybrid (Small discount + free ship):**
   - Best of both
   - More complex to communicate

**Decision Needed By:** Before launch (can test post-launch)  
**Owner:** Offer Strategy lead  
**How to Resolve:** A/B test post-launch, use industry benchmark for initial  
**Related:** Offer Strategy, Unit Economics (LTV calculation)

## 🟢 MEDIUM (Can Defer But Should Document)

### Q5: What Content Marketing Strategy?

**Status:** DEFERRED - focus on paid acquisition first  

**The Question:**
What role does content marketing play in acquisition strategy?

**Why It Matters:**
- Affects resource allocation
- Affects CAC blended rate
- SEO takes 6-12 months to show results
- May be lower priority than paid channels

**Current Assumption:**
Minimal content initially, focus on paid acquisition

**Decision Needed By:** Post-launch, once paid channels validated  
**Owner:** Marketing team  
**Related:** Channel Strategy, GTM plan

---

### Q6: What Influencer Strategy - Macro or Micro?

**Status:** NEEDS ANALYSIS  

**The Question:**
Focus on macro influencers (100K+ followers) or micro (10K-50K)?

**Why It Matters:**
- Different economics (macro = expensive, micro = affordable)
- Different ROI profiles
- Different content styles
- Affects influencer budget allocation

**Options:**
1. **Macro focus:** Big reach, expensive, lower engagement rate
2. **Micro focus:** Smaller reach, affordable, higher engagement
3. **Hybrid:** Test both, optimize based on ROAS

**Decision Needed By:** Before influencer outreach begins  
**Owner:** Influencer marketing lead  
**Related:** Channel Strategy, Unit Economics (CAC by channel)
