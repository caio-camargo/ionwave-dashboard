### EF-001: Track A / Track B Work Pattern

**Pattern Observed:**

**Stability:**  
This pattern repeats across multiple deliverables (Market Intel, Customer Research, etc.)

**Why It's Stable:**  
Reflects fundamental constraint: strategic thinking can happen immediately, data collection requires resources

**Implication:**  
Build all protocols around this two-track structure

**Status:** ✅ EIGENFORM - proven stable across contexts
