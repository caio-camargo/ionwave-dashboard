I want to minimize the number of regrets I have.'\n\nI knew that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not \ngoing to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I \nthought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed, I wouldn't \nregret that. But I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried.\"\n\n— Jeff Bezos",
