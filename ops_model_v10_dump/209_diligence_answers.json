      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "MARKET & COMPETITION"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: How do you know the market is $7B?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: Euromonitor and Grand View Research both size the global electrolyte/hydration market at $7-8B with 8% CAGR. The supplement market overall is $52B. We're targeting the intersection."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: Why won't LMNT crush you?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: Three reasons: (1) They're locked into synthetic supply chains—switching to marine plasma is a major operational change. (2) Their brand is built on simplicity (3 minerals), adding 78 would confuse positioning. (3) They move slow—big companies take 12-18 months to launch new products. We need to be profitable before that window closes."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: What's your moat?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: Honest answer: we don't have one yet. We're building toward brand authenticity with biohackers, supplier relationships, and customer LTV. The real moat comes from being first credible #2 in accessible marine plasma before the market is saturated."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: Why hasn't Seaonic scaled?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: We don't know for certain. Our hypothesis: $69 price point limits market to ultra-premium buyers, and they appear under-invested in paid acquisition. We're testing whether $47-59 unlocks a larger addressable market."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "UNIT ECONOMICS"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: Show me the math on unit economics."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: Revenue: $47 (sub) or $59 (one-time). COGS: $18-20 landed (38-43%). Fulfillment: $8-9 (17-19%). Gross margin: ~40-45%. At $35 CAC, first-order contribution is negative. But with 35% repeat rate and 12-month subscriber lifetime, LTV:CAC is 3-4x."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: What if CAC is $50 instead of $35?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: At $50 CAC and $20 contribution margin, we need 2.5 orders to break even. With 35% repeat rate, average customer does 1.35 orders = not viable. We'd need to improve CVR, increase AOV, or reduce COGS. This is why Week 6 is a kill gate if CAC >$50."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: Why is your margin lower than LMNT's?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: Marine plasma costs more than synthetic compounds—that's the tradeoff for a differentiated product. LMNT's COGS is probably $3-5/box. Ours is $15-20. We offset with similar pricing and the value proposition of 78 minerals vs 3."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: What's your break-even ROAS?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: At 40% gross margin, break-even ROAS = 1 / 0.40 = 2.5x. We're targeting 2.0-2.5x blended, which means we need strong retention and upsells to be profitable, not just first-order economics."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "RISK & EXECUTION"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: What's the worst case scenario?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: Complete loss of the $30-50K raise. Most likely path: COGS comes in high, ads don't validate, we kill at Week 4-6 after ~$15-20K spent. Bounded loss because of stage gates."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: What if ads just don't work?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: We test 50+ creatives across multiple angles. If nothing works after $3-5K spend with iteration, we kill. The thesis is invalidated—marine plasma may not be acquirable at viable CAC in this market."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: What happens if LMNT launches marine plasma?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: If they launch and we're profitable: we either get acquired, compete on authenticity, or serve a niche. If they launch and we're not profitable: bad outcome, which is why speed matters."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: How do you handle supplier dependency?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: We're sourcing from established European suppliers (Biocean, Actimar) with 20+ year track records. We'll have 2 qualified suppliers before scaling. Marine plasma isn't proprietary—multiple sources exist."

    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: Why will this operator succeed?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: [CUSTOMIZE: Background, skin in game, why this category, coachability, time commitment]"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: What's Studio 4's track record?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: Studio 4 uses a systematic methodology adapted from institutional frameworks (PMI, NASA, ISO). This trade is early in the portfolio. The value is operational oversight, accountability systems, and shared learnings—not track record."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: How do you prevent fraud/mismanagement?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: Screen recording of all work, daily check-ins, weekly gate assessments, CM oversight, financial controls via shared dashboards. Operator has equity stake and accountability."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: What does 'passive after 3 months' mean?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: It doesn't. Reduced operational intensity, not passive. Operator remains accountable, systems are running, but day-to-day is less intense. Studio oversight continues."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "FINANCIALS & RETURNS"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: When do I get my money back?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: Primary path: PE acquisition at 4-6x EBITDA in Year 3-5. $500K EBITDA = $2-3M exit. Your SAFE converts at exit. Secondary paths: distributions from profits (Year 2+), strategic acquisition, or operator buyout."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: Why not raise more?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: $30-50K gets us to profitability or a clear kill decision. Raising more would dilute you unnecessarily and give us capital to waste. We're capital-efficient by design."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: What's the fundraising timeline?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: Investor outreach starts Week 6, parallel to validation. If unit economics work, we aim to close within 3 weeks of outreach. We're raising on traction, not thesis."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "Q: What are the SAFE terms?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "A: $250-500K cap, standard YC SAFE. Your $50K converts to ~10-20% ownership at cap depending on raise amount."

    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "RED FLAGS TO ADDRESS PROACTIVELY"

    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "• We have no traction yet — acknowledge, explain validation plan"

      "IONWAVE INVESTOR DILIGENCE ANSWERS": "• Margins are tighter than pure-play supplement brands — explain differentiation tradeoff"
