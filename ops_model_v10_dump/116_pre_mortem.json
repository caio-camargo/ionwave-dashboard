Our CAC hovered \naround $55-60, and despite testing dozens of creative angles, we couldn't get it \nbelow $45. \n\nAt $55 CAC with $14 contribution margin, we were losing $41 per customer acquired. \nWe burned through our initial capital in 6 months, and by Month 8, we had to pause \nads entirely. We tried organic/content but couldn't generate enough volume.\n\nBy Month 10, we faced a choice: raise money at a bad valuation or shut down. We \nchose to shut down and return remaining capital.\n\nLessons: We should have validated CAC assumptions with smaller tests before \ncommitting capital. We should have had a clearer kill criteria and stuck to it \nat Month 3 instead of hoping things would improve.'\n\n—The post-mortem we're trying to avoid writing."
