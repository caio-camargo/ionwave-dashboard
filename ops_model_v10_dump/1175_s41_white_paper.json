      "COORDINATION ARTIFACTS AS MANAGEMENT SUBSTITUTES": "We present the design of a coordination artifact — a structured document containing 104 domain models across 1,174 tabs — engineered to replace centralized management in the creation of a new consumer venture. The artifact, called a Trade, encodes the complete operational imagination for a direct-to-consumer electrolyte company (IonWave), organized as an interconnected set of Trade Unit Projects (TUPs) spanning product science, supply chain, regulatory compliance, financial modeling, brand identity, content production, and go-to-market strategy.\n\nDrawing on Stanford's flash teams model (Valentine & Bernstein, 2025), swarm intelligence research (Nagpal et al.; Couzin et al.), and mechanism design theory (Roughgarden, 2016), we propose that a sufficiently detailed coordination artifact can serve as the primary coordination mechanism for a distributed team of 40-60 flash contributors — each interacting only with their assigned portion of the artifact and an AI co-pilot (Claude, Anthropic) — producing expert-grade output with zero centralized management after initial conditions are set.\n\nThis paper describes the artifact's architecture, the organizational model it enables, the theoretical foundations it draws from, and the experiment we intend to run. We present the Trade not as a business plan but as an applied research instrument: a test of whether coordination can be fully encoded in a document, eliminating the need for a manager, a meeting, or a shared office."

      "COORDINATION ARTIFACTS AS MANAGEMENT SUBSTITUTES": "Launching a consumer business requires coordinating dozens of specialized domains — formulation chemistry, regulatory compliance, supply chain logistics, brand design, media buying, financial modeling, legal structure — into a coherent whole. Traditionally, this coordination is performed by a founder or management team: human beings who hold the complete vision in their heads and translate it into instructions, meetings, Slack messages, and one-on-one conversations.\n\nThis model has three structural problems. First, it doesn't scale: the founder becomes a bottleneck as complexity increases. Second, it doesn't transfer: when the founder leaves, the coordination capacity leaves with them. Third, it doesn't compound: every new hire requires the founder to re-explain the vision, losing fidelity with each retelling.\n\nWe propose an alternative: externalize the founder's coordination capacity into an artifact — a document so detailed that it can instruct a stranger what to do, what 'done' looks like, what decisions have already been made, and what decisions remain open — without ever speaking to the founder.\n\nThis is not a business plan. A business plan describes what a company intends to do. A coordination artifact describes, at the level of individual work assignments, HOW every domain of the company should be built, by whom, to what standard, verified by what expert, and connected to what adjacent domains. The distinction is between a map and a set of turn-by-turn directions."

Members are matched to tasks based on skills, coordinated by computational workflows, and paid per deliverable.\n\nWe extend flash teams in three ways. First, the coordination software is the Trade itself — a static document rather than a dynamic platform. Each TUP's P-tab is a computational workflow compressed into a single page. Second, we add an AI co-pilot (Claude, Anthropic) as a permanent collaborator available to every flash contributor, reducing the need for human-to-human coordination. Third, we add a verification layer (expert grading on V-tabs) that creates quality guarantees without managerial oversight."

      "COORDINATION ARTIFACTS AS MANAGEMENT SUBSTITUTES": "Swarm intelligence research demonstrates that large groups of simple agents — ants, bees, fish, robots — can produce complex, adaptive, intelligent behavior through local interaction rules alone, with no central controller (Nagpal et al., Kilobots; Couzin et al., collective decision-making; Dorigo, ant colony optimization).\n\nThe Trade applies swarm principles to human organizational coordination. Each flash contributor is an agent with local information (their TUP's tabs) and simple rules (read P-tab, produce content, submit to librarian). The librarian is an information routing mechanism — analogous to pheromone trails in ant colonies — that distributes outputs across the system without understanding their content. The MC (Master of Ceremonies) is a signal amplification mechanism that broadcasts entrance and exit events, maintaining system awareness without requiring point-to-point communication.\n\nThe hypothesis is that these local interaction rules — mediated by the artifact rather than by a manager — produce emergent coordination: a coherent, expert-grade operating model for a consumer venture, built by strangers who never meet."

    {
      "COORDINATION ARTIFACTS AS MANAGEMENT SUBSTITUTES": "Mechanism design theory asks: given a desired outcome, what rules of interaction will cause self-interested agents to produce that outcome? (Roughgarden, Twenty Lectures on Algorithmic Game Theory, 2016). In blockchain governance, this question becomes: what token structures, voting mechanisms, and incentive schemes cause decentralized participants to maintain a protocol? (Buterin, various blog posts on coordination, governance, and quadratic funding; Buterin, Hitzig & Weyl, 'Liberal Radicalism,' 2019).\n\nThe Trade is a mechanism design problem. The desired outcome is a complete, expert-grade operating model. The agents are flash contributors with heterogeneous skills, limited information, and self-interest (equity, portfolio artifacts, credentials). The mechanism is the artifact itself: P-tabs define scope (constraining behavior), C-tabs define incentives (equity conditional on expert grade), V-tabs define verification (quality enforcement), and the librarian enforces information routing (preventing uncoordinated action).\n\nThe equity structure — 0.1-0.5% per sprint, vesting only upon V-tab grade of B or above — is an incentive-compatible mechanism: contributors who produce high-quality work are rewarded; those who don't are not. No manager needs to evaluate performance. The expert's grade IS the mechanism."

    {
      "COORDINATION ARTIFACTS AS MANAGEMENT SUBSTITUTES": "The author's prior work on coordination theory (coordinationprotocols.com) proposes that the optimal organizational design achieves maximum variety with the fewest rules. A coordination protocol is a minimal set of constraints that enables maximal emergent behavior — analogous to a grammar that enables infinite sentences, or a protocol that enables infinite applications.\n\nThe Trade is an empirical test of this principle. 1,174 tabs of structure may appear to be 'many rules,' but each TUP is self-contained: a contributor needs only their 5-7 tabs to operate. The global structure exists for the system's benefit (cross-references, dependencies, coherence), not for the contributor's burden. The contributor's experience is local and simple. The system's behavior is global and complex. This is the defining characteristic of well-designed coordination protocols."

It assembles a digital community (flash contributors), organizes them around a shared artifact (the Trade), coordinates them through software (the librarian's Google Drive structure + Claude as AI co-pilot), and produces a real-world output (a launched consumer business). The contributor base is globally distributed, may never meet, and is coordinated entirely by the artifact. The parallel to Srinivasan's 'cloud-first, then physical' model is precise: the Trade is cloud-first operational imagination that materializes into a physical business."

These are connective tissue — they keep the system running but make no strategic decisions.\n\nFlash roles (40-60 people, 1-4 weeks each): PM co-founders (produce 4-8 TUPs per cluster), Expert reviewers (grade TUPs, 10-20 hours), Specialists (funnel builder, series producer, product designer). Each flash contributor enters, produces a scoped deliverable, and dissolves.\n\nThe founder (Vicioso) is an on-call subject matter expert who writes specific essays when asked.

Vesting is conditional: equity vests only upon V-tab expert grade of B or above. No grade, no vest.\n\nThis creates incentive compatibility without managerial oversight. The contributor's payoff is a function of an independent expert's assessment of their work quality, not a manager's subjective evaluation. The expert has no equity stake in the outcome — they are a flash reviewer who grades and dissolves.\n\nAdditional non-monetary incentives: portfolio artifacts (the contributor can show their work), credentials ('Produced the [X] model for a 104-TUP venture studio Trade'), network access (MC conversations are published, creating public visibility), and career booster statements (each P-tab includes a resume line)."

Cross-TUP dependencies are documented in P-tabs. The full Trade is available read-only for context. No interpretation needed — the document speaks for itself.\n\n2. The librarian (routing): When Contributor A's output is needed by Contributor B's TUP, the librarian routes it. The librarian does not interpret, edit, or evaluate — she routes. This is a gossip protocol for organizational knowledge: information propagates through a routing node, not through point-to-point communication between contributors.\n\n3. The AI co-pilot (amplification): Claude (Anthropic) is available to every contributor as a drafting partner, domain researcher, and quality checker. The AI has access to the full Trade for context. This means every contributor has, effectively, a senior colleague who has read the entire 1,174-tab document and can answer questions about cross-domain dependencies in real time.\n\nNo meetings. No standups. No Slack channels. Information flows through artifact, librarian, and AI."

If the entity structure is wrong, if the equity math doesn't add up, if the IP assignment language has holes — every TUP built on top inherits the error.\n\nWe therefore define a Week 0 audit gate: a 10-point structural audit conducted by a steward (not the founder) with outside expert review (lawyer, DAO consultant, cap table specialist). The audit covers entity structure, cap table math, contract templates, IP assignment, DAO governance, Trade integrity, role rosters, equity distribution mechanics, financial reality, and recruiting readiness.\n\nThe audit produces a binary verdict: CONFIRMED (system safe to open) or FIX FIRST (specific items listed). Once confirmed, the artifact is certified and the production cycle begins. This is the only gate. After this, the artifact manages itself."

      "COORDINATION ARTIFACTS AS MANAGEMENT SUBSTITUTES": "7. IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE WORK"
    },
    {
      "COORDINATION ARTIFACTS AS MANAGEMENT SUBSTITUTES": "If the experiment succeeds — if 40-60 strangers, coordinated only by a document and an AI co-pilot, produce an expert-grade operating model for a consumer venture — the implications extend beyond this single case.\n\nFor organizational design: Management may not be a permanent function but a temporary one — necessary during the creation of a coordination artifact, unnecessary once the artifact is complete. The founder's role shifts from 'person who coordinates' to 'person who encodes coordination and exits.'\n\nFor venture creation: The cost of launching a company drops to the cost of producing the artifact. No payroll during the imagination phase. No office. No meetings. Equity-only compensation for flash contributors who each spend 1-4 weeks. The Trade becomes a replicable template: build once for electrolytes, fork for supplements, skincare, pet food, any D2C category.\n\nFor AI-augmented work: Claude's role as co-pilot to every contributor creates a novel hybrid intelligence model — the artifact provides structural context, the AI provides conversational context, and the human provides domain expertise. This three-way collaboration (artifact + AI + human) may represent a new organizational primitive.\n\nFor decentralized governance: The Trade is a DAO without a blockchain. The coordination mechanisms — artifact-mediated task assignment, expert-verified quality, conditional equity vesting — are governance mechanisms implemented in a spreadsheet rather than a smart contract. This suggests that the core problem in decentralized organization is not the technology (blockchain, tokens, voting) but the coordination artifact (the document that tells agents what to do). DAOs may fail not because their smart contracts are poorly designed but because their coordination artifacts are insufficiently detailed.\n\nFuture work: Run the experiment. Measure the variables. Publish the results. If successful, replicate across multiple Trades (different businesses) to test generalizability. Develop Trade-authoring tools (AI-assisted coordination artifact generators) to reduce the production cost of new Trades."
