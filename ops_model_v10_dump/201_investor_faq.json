      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Q: Why marine plasma vs regular electrolytes?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "The short answer: bioavailability and completeness."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Regular electrolyte products like LMNT give you 3-6 minerals in synthetic form. Your body absorbs maybe 10-20% of pill-based minerals, slightly better for powders."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Marine plasma contains 78 ionic minerals in the exact ratios found in human blood plasma. This isn't a coincidence—René Quinton documented in 1897 that human blood plasma is 98% identical to seawater in mineral composition."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Ionic minerals are already in the form your body uses. No conversion needed. Absorption rates around 98%."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "The science: your body evolved using ocean-derived minerals for millions of years before we existed on land. Synthetic supplements are a 50-year-old invention trying to replicate what nature already perfected."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "This matters commercially because customers actually feel the difference—which drives retention and word-of-mouth."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Q: Isn't this just expensive seawater?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "No, and this is the most common objection so I'll be thorough:"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Regular seawater is approximately 35 grams of salt per liter. If you drank it, you'd get sick."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Marine plasma is harvested from a specific ocean depth (around 30 meters) where phytoplankton activity creates a unique mineral concentration that closely matches human blood plasma ratios. It's then filtered to remove sodium excess while preserving the trace mineral profile."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "The product Quinton developed—still sold in European pharmacies—goes through a specific cold filtration process that maintains mineral integrity."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "We're not selling ocean water. We're selling a concentrated, filtered mineral matrix that happens to come from the ocean. The sourcing and processing is what makes it valuable, not the raw ingredient."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Think of it like olive oil vs. olives. Same source, very different product."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Q: Why can you beat LMNT on price?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Three reasons:"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "1. No celebrity endorsement costs. LMNT reportedly pays Huberman, Rogan, and others significant fees—estimates suggest $500K+ annually per major influencer. We're going UGC and organic-first."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "2. No synthetic ingredient patents or licensing. We're using a natural product with established suppliers, not proprietary formulations."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "3. Direct sourcing from established suppliers. Companies like Biocean and Actimar have been producing marine plasma for decades for European markets. We're not inventing a supply chain."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "We're also not trying to be cheaper—$47-59 vs $45 is price parity. We're trying to be better value: more minerals, better absorption, similar price."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "The margin structure works: ~$0.45 COGS per sachet, $1.50-2.00 retail price per serving, 65-75% gross margin. That's actually better than LMNT's estimated margins because we're not paying influencer fees."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Q: What's the moat?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Honestly? We don't have one yet. And I won't pretend we do."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Here's what we're building toward:"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "1. Speed to market. First credible #2 in marine plasma electrolytes captures supplier relationships, customer base, and category positioning. Seaonic exists but is ultra-premium ($69/box). We're the accessible option."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "2. Customer LTV. Subscription model with 40%+ subscription rate means predictable revenue and high lifetime value. Hard for competitors to poach sticky customers."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "3. Brand authenticity. We're building for the biohacker/optimizer community who values transparency and science. That audience is loyal when you earn trust."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "4. Operational efficiency. Studio 4 backing means we run leaner than venture-backed competitors chasing growth at all costs."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "But I'll be direct: if LMNT launches a marine plasma product tomorrow with Huberman promoting it, we have a problem. Our bet is they won't for 12-18 months because big companies move slow and marine plasma doesn't fit their synthetic supply chain."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "We need to be profitable and defensible before that window closes."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Q: How do you know ads will work?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "We don't—until we test. But here's why we think the odds are good:"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "1. LMNT spends $1M+/month profitably on Meta/YouTube. The category converts."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "2. Seaonic exists at $69/box and has paying customers. Marine plasma specifically converts."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "3. The biohacker audience is concentrated and targetable: Huberman listeners, Attia followers, r/biohackers, keto/carnivore communities."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "4. We have clear differentiation angles: natural vs synthetic, 78 minerals vs 3, ocean-sourced vs lab-made."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Our approach is test fast, kill fast. $3K ad spend in Week 3-4 tells us if the creative resonates. If CTR >1.5% and CVR >2.5%, we scale. If not, we iterate or kill."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "We're not betting $50K on untested ads. We're betting $3K to learn, then scaling what works."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Q: What if LMNT launches marine plasma?"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "It's a real risk, and we've thought about it:"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Scenario A (most likely): They don't, for 12-18 months. Big companies are slow. Their supply chain is synthetic. Switching costs are real. And marine plasma is still a tiny segment."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Scenario B: They launch and we're already profitable. In this case, we either: (a) get acquired as a category brand, (b) compete on authenticity and price, or (c) keep serving our niche profitably while they chase mass market."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Scenario C: They launch and we're not profitable yet. This is the bad scenario. Mitigation: we're targeting 8-12 weeks to profitability specifically to avoid this."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Honestly, if LMNT launches marine plasma, it validates the category and probably grows the overall market. The question is whether we've built enough brand equity to survive their marketing spend. That's why speed matters."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Q: Why this operator?"

    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Why it's bounded:"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "1. Kill triggers at each stage. If COGS >$0.60, we kill in Week 1. If ads fail after $3K, we kill or pivot in Week 4."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "2. Operator has skin in the game. They're not going to burn your money on hopeless iteration."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "3. Staged capital deployment. We're not spending $50K on inventory before ads validate."
    },

    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Expected loss in worst case: $15-20K (early kill after COGS validation and initial ad test), not the full $50K."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Best case: $6-9M exit in 3-5 years. Risk/reward is asymmetric in your favor."

    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "We don't need more. $30-50K gets us to profitability or a clear kill decision. Raising more would dilute you unnecessarily and give us capital to waste."

    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Consumer-focused PE funds like TSG Consumer, L Catterton, and similar acquire DTC brands at 4-6x EBITDA. At $500K EBITDA, that's a $2-3M acquisition. At $1.5M EBITDA, that's $6-9M."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Your return: Pro-rata share of exit proceeds based on ownership percentage."

    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "2. STRATEGIC ACQUISITION (Opportunistic)"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Larger supplement brands (Nestlé Health Science, Unilever, private equity portfolio companies) acquire category leaders. Multiples can reach 8-15x for strategic fit."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "Timeline: Could happen earlier if we get noticed, typically Year 2-4."
    },

      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "3. DISTRIBUTIONS (Ongoing, Year 2+)"
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "If we're profitable and not raising more capital, we can distribute profits to shareholders. At 20-40% of net income distributed, a $50K investment could yield $10-20K annually."
    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "This is the \"lifestyle business\" outcome—not a home run, but steady returns."

    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "If the operator wants to take full ownership, they can buy out investors at a negotiated multiple. Typically 1.5-3x invested capital."

    },
    {
      "IONWAVE INVESTOR FAQ — FULL ANSWERS": "SAFE terms convert at the exit event. Your $50K at a $250-500K cap means you own 10-20% of the company. If we exit at $5M, that's $500K-1M to you."
