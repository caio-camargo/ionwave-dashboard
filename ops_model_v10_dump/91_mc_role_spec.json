    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "The MC is not a VA. Not an actor. Not a host reading a script."

      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "The MC is the person who sits with every person working on every project"
    },

    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "'So what are we actually doing this week?'"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "The MC doesn't need to understand the Trade. They need to NOT understand it."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "Their ignorance is the product. Their questions are what force clarity."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "The conversations get recorded. They live on the site. They ARE the content."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "They're also the institutional knowledge capture — because they document"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "WHY decisions were made, not just what was decided."

      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "For each model, the MC sits with whoever is working on it and talks through:"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• What is this model about? (The MC asks, the expert/PM/operator explains)"
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• What are the hard parts? (Where are the risks, unknowns, disagreements?)"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• What did we learn? (After expert sessions, after production, after launch)"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "These conversations serve FIVE purposes simultaneously:"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "1. LEGIBILITY — If the MC can understand it, anyone can understand it."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "If the MC is confused, the plan isn't clear enough yet."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "2. CONTENT — The recordings are the site's primary content."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "Not polished productions. Real conversations. Cinematic quality audio/video"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "but raw, unscripted content."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "3. ESSAYS — The MC asking 'what is a Compliance Manager and why do we need one'"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "IS the essay explaining the novel concept. Transcribed, it becomes the IP tab."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "4. INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE — Every decision, every rationale, every disagreement"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "is captured. New team members watch the conversations to onboard."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "5. INVESTOR PROOF — Investors watching these conversations see a real team"
    },
    {

      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "WHO THE MC INTERVIEWS"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "Everyone. The MC talks to every person in the system about their domain:"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• Nilo — The thesis. Why this exists. The coordination hedgefund. The vision."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• PM co-founder — The plan. What's happening this week. What's working."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• Experts — Their domain. What the AI got wrong. What good looks like."
    },
    {

    },
    {

    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• Operators — When they join. Who they are. Why they said yes."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• Future hires — As cast members join. Introduction conversations."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "The MC is the connective tissue. They're the only person who talks to"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "EVERYONE about EVERYTHING. That makes them the best-informed person"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "in the system after Nilo — and their understanding is the baseline"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "for what external audiences can understand."

    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• Comfortable with not knowing — Willing to say 'I don't understand, say that again'"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• Good listener — Follows up on the interesting thing, not the next question on a list"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• Articulate — Can summarize what they just heard back to the person cleanly"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• Consistent — Shows up every day. This is a rhythm, not a performance."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "• Warm — People enjoy talking to them. Interviewees open up, don't perform."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "Think: podcast host energy. Joe Rogan asking a physicist to explain black holes."
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "The MC doesn't need to be the smartest person. They need to be the most curious."

    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "This is the VA work. But framing it as 'MC who also does admin' is different"
    },
    {
      "THE MC — MASTER OF CEREMONIES": "from 'VA who also does videos.' The identity is MC first. The admin supports it."
    },

    },
    {
