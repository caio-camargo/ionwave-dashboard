## What This Project Does

**Dual Purpose:**
1. **Improve & Complete IonWave**: Elevate quality from 4-6/10 to 8-9/10 and fill out all 38 Trade files completely
2. **Build the Imagination Generation System**: Create reusable frameworks and methodologies that work across all Studio 3 Trades

**Working Mode:** Improve example → extract patterns → codify → test → iterate

**Current Phase:** Bootstrap complete, system established - now executing systematically across all deliverables

---

## Current File Structure

### Data Layer — `data/` (JSON, machine-optimized)
**This is the primary data source for Claude and the dashboard.**

Files 01-03B have been migrated from XLSX to JSON. Remaining files (04-38) are still XLSX-only, pending migration.

```
data/
├── manifest.json                         ← MASTER INDEX: Load this first for full project orientation
├── hypotheses/                           ← 🧪 HYPOTHESES ARCHITECTURE (ontological primitive)
│   ├── registry.json                     ← Central registry of 8 core business hypotheses
│   ├── index.json                        ← Bidirectional hypothesis ↔ document linking
│   └── validation_log.json               ← Chronological event log (11+ events)
├── 01_strategic_foundation/              ← 5 sheets (migrated)
│   ├── _meta.json                        ← File-level metadata, dependencies, feedback loops
│   ├── assumptions_register.json
│   ├── interview_insights.json
│   ├── narrative_hypotheses.json
│   ├── odd1_thesis.json
│   └── thesis.json
├── 02_market_intelligence/               ← 10 sheets (migrated)
│   ├── _meta.json
│   └── ... (10 sheet files)
├── 03a_customer_research_icp/            ← 5 sheets (migrated, consolidated from 6)
│   ├── _meta.json
│   └── ... (5 sheet files)
└── 03b_customer_research_voc/            ← 7 sheets (migrated, consolidated from 9)
    ├── _meta.json
    └── ... (7 sheet files)
```

**Key points:**
- `manifest.json` replaces `Master_Index.md` for machine use — contains all 38 files, dependency chains, feedback loops, and migration status
- **`hypotheses/`** — Central registry treating business assumptions as **ontological primitives** with validation tracking
- Each `_meta.json` contains file-level metadata: quality scores, dependencies, blockers, next actions
- Each sheet JSON has a `_meta` envelope with `data_type`, `quality_score`, `status`, and `version`
- Data types: `structured_table`, `narrative`, `hybrid`, `template`
- Inline confidence metadata on data points where applicable (A/B/C/D grading)

**For migrating more files:** See `processes/JSON_Migration_Guide.md`
**For hypothesis tracking:** See `data/hypotheses/registry.json` and dashboard hypotheses tracker

### IonWave Trade Files (34 remaining) — `IonWave/`
**Files 04-38 are still in XLSX format, pending JSON migration.**

**Organized Structure:**
- 04: Planning & Roadmaps
- 05-08: Product & Economics (Product Strategy, Formulation/Supply, Offer Strategy, Unit Economics, Financial Model)
- 09-14: Brand & Creative (Brand/Messaging, Creative Strategy/Production, Funnel, Pages/Email, Media, Content, Community)
- 15-19: Operations (Operations/Fulfillment, Team, Legal, Analytics, Systems/Automation)
- 20-38: Growth & Support (Fundraising, Expansion, R&D, Decision Support, Partnerships, and Cross-Functional domains)

**Reference:** See `data/manifest.json` for complete file inventory with migration status, or `Master_Index.md` for legacy sheet-by-sheet listing

### Dashboard — `dashboard/`
**Dynamic multi-page dashboard powered by JSON data layer.**
```
dashboard/
├── index.html                    ← Mission Control (loads manifest.json)
├── css/styles.css                ← Dark theme stylesheet
├── js/
│   ├── data-loader.js            ← Fetches and caches JSON data
│   └── renderers.js              ← Auto-renders content by data_type
└── views/
    ├── hypotheses-tracker.html   ← 🧪 Hypotheses system tracker (NEW)
    ├── financial-forecast.html   ← 📊 Financial model scenarios
    ├── strategic-foundation.html
    ├── market-intelligence.html
    └── customer-research.html    ← Combined 03A + 03B view
```

**Live at:** https://caio-camargo.github.io/ionwave-dashboard/

- **File Views** - Dynamic rendering of migrated JSON data by file (01-03B currently available)

### Documentation Folders
```
IonWave/        → Analysis deliverables (Strategic Foundation, Porter's, ICP, Market Sizing, Financial Model, etc.)
core/           → Required reading (02_Glossary, 03_What_We_Did, 04_Working_Principles)
standards/      → Standards & guidelines (metadata, versioning, deliverable structure)
systems/        → System overviews (CM, ODD, School, TUP, Trade, etc.)
tracking/       → 42 live tracking logs (append-only, not versioned) + Open_Questions.md
processes/      → Process docs (Dependency_Map, JSON_Migration_Guide, demos)
ci-protocol/    → Competitive Intelligence Protocol (10-file workflow)
archive/        → Deprecated/historical files (including migrated XLSX files)
```

**Key Analysis Deliverables (`IonWave/`):**
- Strategic_Foundation_Analysis.md - Thesis reconciliation, capital tension analysis
- Porter_Five_Forces_Analysis.md - Market structure analysis
- ICP_Analysis.md - Customer segmentation, jobs-to-be-done
- Marine_Plasma_Market_Sizing.md - TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, Seaonic revenue estimation
- Financial_Model_Revenue_Validation.md - 3-scenario financial model (18-month base case)
- **Hypothesis_Dependency_Audit.md** - Comprehensive audit mapping 8 hypotheses to 35+ documents

### Version Control — Git / GitHub

**Repo:** https://github.com/caio-camargo/ionwave-dashboard
**Branch:** `main` (deployed to GitHub Pages), `master` (local working branch)

**`.gitignore` policy:**
- `*.xlsx` — XLSX files are NOT version-controlled. JSON is source of truth for migrated files; non-migrated XLSX remain local only.
- `archive/` — Deprecated/historical files
- `.claude/` — Claude Code internal state
- Python artifacts, OS files

**What gets committed:** `data/`, `dashboard/`, `processes/`, `standards/`, `core/`, `ci-protocol/`, root `.md` files, `IonWave/*.md` analysis deliverables.

**What does NOT get committed:** `IonWave/*.xlsx`, `archive/`, `.claude/`

**Deployment:** Push to `origin/main` → auto-deploys to GitHub Pages. See `DASHBOARD_UPDATE_GUIDE.md` for deploy procedure.

### Deprecated Files (Reference Only)
**IonWave_Ops_Model_v10_Organized.xlsx** - 681-sheet comprehensive model
- Status: Deprecated, maintained for reference only
- Very large file - avoid opening unless specific need
- Superseded by 38 organized Trade files → now being migrated to JSON

**File Evolution:** v8 (88 sheets) → v10 (681 sheets) → 38 organized XLSX files → JSON data layer (in progress)

## Required Reading (In Order)

**Every session, read these first:**

1. **This document** (00_START_HERE.md) ← You are here
2. **`data/manifest.json`** - Machine-readable project index (all 38 files, dependencies, migration status)
3. **core/02_Glossary.md** - Key terminology and definitions
4. **core/03_What_We_Did.md** - Project history and methodology evolution
5. **core/04_Working_Principles_updated.md** - How we work together

**When working with Trade file data:**
- **Migrated files (01-03B):** Read from `data/{file_id}/` — load `_meta.json` first, then individual sheet JSONs
- **Non-migrated files (04-38):** Still in `IonWave/` as XLSX — requires openpyxl or manual reading
- **Migration process:** See `processes/JSON_Migration_Guide.md`

**When creating any document:**
- **standards/Document_Metadata_Standards.md** - Required metadata, versioning rules, document classes

**When looking for something:**
- **`data/manifest.json`** - Primary index: all 38 files with migration status, dependencies, quality scores
- **DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md** - Complete inventory of all documentation files
- **Master_Index.md** - Legacy sheet-by-sheet index (still accurate for non-migrated files)
- **processes/Dependency_Map.md** - File relationships and workflow sequences

---

## Key Standards & Guidelines

### Documentation Standards
- **Metadata Required**: Version, Author, Date, Purpose, Status (AI Model if AI-generated)
- **Versioning**: Auto-increment patch (+0.0.1), tracked in standards/VERSION_MANIFEST.md
- **Document Classes**: Versioned operational, Methodology/framework, Ephemeral process, Live tracking

See `standards/Document_Metadata_Standards.md` for complete requirements.

### Quality Standards
- **Confidence Grading**: A/B/C/D scale for all factual claims
  - A: Verified from authoritative source
  - B: Strong single source or good triangulation
  - C: Industry benchmark with documented methodology
  - D: Best guess with documented upgrade path

- **Hypotheses Architecture**: Business assumptions tracked as ontological primitives
  - **Registry**: `data/hypotheses/registry.json` - 8 core hypotheses with revision history
  - **Index**: `data/hypotheses/index.json` - Bidirectional hypothesis ↔ document linking (53+ refs)
  - **Validation Log**: `data/hypotheses/validation_log.json` - Chronological event log
  - **State Machine**: ASSUMED → TESTING → VALIDATED/INVALIDATED
  - **Grading**: A/B/C/D confidence grades with transparent weak link detection
  - **Dependencies**: feeds_into/depends_on relationships showing hypothesis chains
  - **View**: https://caio-camargo.github.io/ionwave-dashboard/views/hypotheses-tracker.html

- **Deliverable Structure**: Three mandatory sections
  - Section 1: Main Content (with inline confidence tags)
  - Section 2: Intelligence Gaps (what we don't know, impact analysis, validation paths)
  - Section 3: Scorecard (quality self-assessment, upgrade shopping list)

See `core/04_Working_Principles_updated.md` for complete evidence standards.
See `IonWave/Hypothesis_Dependency_Audit.md` for hypothesis system documentation.

### Inline Quality Documentation
**Every claim must self-document its quality:**
```
[Confidence: A | Source: drinklmnt.com/pricing | Verified: 2026-01-31]
```

See `standards/Deliverable_Structure_Standards.md` for detailed requirements.

## How to Work with This System

### Question-Driven Workflow
**ALWAYS ask clarifying questions before producing deliverables**

Claude will ask 10-20 structured questions to understand:
- Purpose and audience
- Scope and boundaries
- Success criteria
- Time/resource constraints
- Tone and format preferences

**Why:** Prevents wasted work, forces clarity, documents rationale, produces better first drafts.

### Track A vs Track B Work

**Track A (Strategic Analysis - Claude Can Help):**
- Applying expert frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, Investor Lens, Customer Anthropologist)
- Mining customer voice from free sources (Reddit, Trustpilot, Amazon, forums)
- Competitive response scenario planning
- Strategic gap analysis
- Time: 4-6 hours | Cost: Free | Quality impact: 4/10 → 6-7/10

**Track B (Data Collection - Human Must Do):**
- SEMrush traffic research
- Paid market reports (IBISWorld, Statista)
- Extensive competitor research with screenshots
- Time: 15-20 hours | Cost: Tool subscriptions + labor | Quality impact: 6-7/10 → 8-9/10

**Principle:** Always start with Track A to get maximum value from existing data before collecting new data.

### Working with Dependencies
Files have dependencies - changing one may require updating others.

See `processes/Dependency_Map.md` for:
- Dependency chains (what feeds into what)
- Workflow sequences (recommended order of work)
- Which files must be updated together

### Finding Things
- **Full project orientation (Claude)?** → `data/manifest.json` (load first every session)
- **Project status at a glance (human)?** → [Dashboard](https://caio-camargo.github.io/ionwave-dashboard/) — see DASHBOARD_UPDATE_GUIDE.md
- **Business hypotheses/assumptions?** → `data/hypotheses/registry.json` or [Hypotheses Tracker](https://caio-camargo.github.io/ionwave-dashboard/views/hypotheses-tracker.html)
- **Hypothesis evidence mapping?** → `data/hypotheses/index.json` or `IonWave/Hypothesis_Dependency_Audit.md`
- **Critical strategic questions?** → `tracking/Open_Questions.md` (Q9, Q10, Q11 analyzed)
- **Specific Trade file data (migrated)?** → `data/{file_id}/` (01-03B available as JSON)
- **Specific Trade file data (not migrated)?** → `IonWave/{filename}.xlsx` (04-38, requires openpyxl)
- **Sheet-level index?** → `data/manifest.json` (migrated files) or `Master_Index.md` (all files)
- **Looking for a document?** → DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
- **Understanding dependencies?** → processes/Dependency_Map.md (or `manifest.json` dependency_chains)
- **Checking current version?** → standards/VERSION_MANIFEST.md
- **Creating a document?** → standards/Document_Metadata_Standards.md
- **Structuring a deliverable?** → standards/Deliverable_Structure_Standards.md
- **Migrating a file to JSON?** → processes/JSON_Migration_Guide.md
- **Running competitive intelligence?** → ci-protocol/00_INDEX.md (full CI workflow)
- **Applying expert frameworks?** → ci-protocol/07_FRAMEWORKS.md (worked examples)

## What Claude Can Do

**Strategic Analysis:**
- Apply expert frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, Skeptical Investor, Customer Anthropologist, Category Expert)
- Synthesize existing data and extract patterns
- Generate strategic recommendations with documented reasoning
- Self-evaluate work against quality criteria with explicit confidence grades

**Research (Limited):**
- Web search for customer voice, reviews, public data
- Find market research sources (though often paywalled)
- Public company information (SEC filings if public)
- Mine customer insights from free sources

**Documentation:**
- Format data into structured deliverables
- Generate content based on templates and frameworks
- Quality check against rubrics and standards
- Identify gaps in evidence and create upgrade paths
- Create properly versioned documents with metadata

**Code & Data:**
- Read/write JSON data layer directly (no Python needed for migrated files)
- Python/openpyxl for XLSX extraction (non-migrated files only)
- Statistical analysis and modeling
- Dashboard and visualization updates
- Automation scripts

---

## Current Work Focus

### Bootstrap Phase Complete ✅
The system has been established through bootstrapping:
- Quality frameworks defined (A/B/C/D grading, deliverable structure)
- File organization complete (38 Trade files)
- Documentation standards set (metadata, versioning)
- Methodologies proven (competitive intelligence, customer voice, expert frameworks)

### JSON Data Layer Migration (In Progress)
Tier 1 files (01-03B) have been migrated from XLSX to JSON:
- JSON data layer optimized for Claude context window (one file per sheet, metadata envelopes)
- Dynamic HTML dashboard replacing old hardcoded single-page dashboard
- `manifest.json` serves as machine-readable project index
- **Hypotheses Architecture** established as ontological primitive (8 core hypotheses, 53+ document references)
- 34 files remain to be migrated (see `processes/JSON_Migration_Guide.md`)
- Migrated XLSX files archived to `archive/xlsx-pre-json-migration/`

### Current Phase: Systematic Execution
Now applying established frameworks to:
- Continue JSON migration (Tier 2+ files as they're worked on)
- Complete all 38 IonWave Trade files
- Build reusable methodologies (Porter's Five Forces, etc.)
- Elevate quality from 4-6/10 to 8-9/10 across all deliverables
- Create proven patterns for future Trades

**Next Actions:** Reference `processes/Dependency_Map.md` for recommended work sequence, or `data/manifest.json` for per-file status and blockers.

---

## Key Principles

**Honesty About Quality:**
- Explicit confidence grades on all claims
- Document what we don't know (intelligence gaps)
- Show upgrade paths (how to improve from C to A)
- D-grade is acceptable if documented with validation path

**Evidence Over Opinion:**
- Source every claim: [Confidence: X | Source: Y | Date: Z]
- 30+ customer quotes minimum for voice of customer
- Methodology documented for all estimates
- "Could be wrong if..." scenarios for uncertainty

**Systematic Over Heroic:**
- Use frameworks and standards, don't reinvent
- Document as you go (inline quality tags)
- Check dependencies before changing files
- Version everything that matters

**Ask Before Assume:**
- Question-driven workflow prevents rework
- Clarify scope and success criteria upfront
- Checkpoint before building (show outline first)
- Validate decisions with explicit rationale

---

## Session Logging (Required)

**This project uses `SESSION_LOG.md` to maintain continuity across sessions.**

### At the start of every session:
1. Read the **last 3 session entries** in `SESSION_LOG.md` (they're reverse chronological — newest first)
2. Pay special attention to the **Next Steps** section of the most recent entry
3. Create a new entry at the top of the log using the template in that file
4. Only read older entries if you need context on a specific decision or file change

### During the session:
- Record all file changes (creates, edits, moves, archives) in the Actions table
- Log decisions and their rationale
- Note any issues or blockers encountered

### At the end of the session:
- Mark the session entry status as `Complete`
- Update the "Next Steps" section with outstanding work
- Ensure every file touched is listed in the Actions table

**Why:** Claude Code sessions don't share context. The session log is the only way to maintain continuity between sessions. If you skip this, the next session starts blind.
