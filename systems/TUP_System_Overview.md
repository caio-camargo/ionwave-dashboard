## TUP KILL CRITERIA

**When to kill a TUP (at each gate):**

### After Idea:
- Market too small (<$100M)
- Competition too intense (no gap)
- Can't find Operator fit

### After Research:
- W Formula score <50
- No clear PMF path
- Competitive moat weak

### After Planning:
- Unit economics don't work
- Can't validate customer need
- Timeline too long (>6 months to launch)

### After Implementation:
- Can't find product-market fit
- CAC too high (>LTV/3)
- Operator wants out

**Kill fast, kill often:** Most TUPs should die before launch

## TUP METRICS

### Pipeline Health:

- Conversion rate between stages

- Kill rate by stage

### Portfolio Balance:
- Mix of stages (don't have all in one stage)
