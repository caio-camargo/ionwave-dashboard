# ODD System Overview

**ODD = Overdetermined Documentation**  
**Purpose:** Systematic documentation approach ensuring nothing gets lost  
**Applies To:** All Studio 3 Trades  
**Owner:** Studio 3 System

---

## WHAT IS ODD

**Overdetermined = Multiple redundant paths to same information**

Instead of single source of truth (which breaks), ODD creates multiple overlapping documentation that reinforces itself.

**Core principle:** Critical information documented in multiple places, multiple formats, from multiple perspectives.

---

## ODD COMPONENTS

### 1. ODD Compilation Map
**What:** Master index of all Trade documentation  
**Purpose:** Know what exists and where to find it  
**Updated:** As documents are created

### 2. ODD Dependency Map
**What:** How documents relate to each other  
**Purpose:** Understand information flow  
**Updated:** When dependencies change

### 3. ODD Completion Sequencer
**What:** Order in which to complete deliverables  
**Purpose:** Logical workflow, prevent blocking  
**Updated:** As Trade progresses

### 4. ODD Status Tracker
**What:** Completion status of all deliverables  
**Purpose:** Know what's done, what's in progress, what's blocked  
**Updated:** Weekly or as status changes

## WHY OVERDETERMINED

**Problem with single source of truth:**
- If document lost, information lost
- If person leaves, knowledge leaves
- If system breaks, everything breaks

**Solution with overdetermination:**
- Information in multiple places
- Lose one source, others remain
- Multiple perspectives reveal gaps
- Cross-validation catches errors

**Example:**
- Revenue projection in: Financial Model, Pitch Deck, Budget, Thesis
- If one shows different number, inconsistency caught
- Forces reconciliation and understanding

## ODD PRINCIPLES

### 1. Critical Info Gets Redundancy
**LOW criticality:** One place is fine  
**MEDIUM criticality:** Two places  
**HIGH criticality:** Three+ places

### 2. Different Formats Reinforce
Same information in:
- Spreadsheet (for calculation)
- Slide (for presentation)
- Document (for explanation)
- Tracker (for monitoring)

### 3. Cross-References Required
Documents should reference related documents:
- "See Financial Model for detailed assumptions"
- "This aligns with Thesis Section 3.2"

### 4. Reconciliation Checks
Periodically verify consistency:
- Do all revenue projections match?
- Are assumptions consistent across docs?
- Have any documents diverged?

---

## ODD WORKFLOW

### At Trade Start:
1. Create ODD Compilation Map
2. Define required deliverables
3. Map dependencies
4. Sequence work

### During Development:
1. Create deliverables in sequence
2. Update Status Tracker
3. Cross-reference as you go
4. Flag inconsistencies immediately

### At Milestones:
1. Reconciliation check
2. Update all related docs
3. Verify consistency
4. Document changes

### At Gates:
1. Full ODD audit
2. All critical deliverables complete?
3. All cross-references valid?
4. Ready for next phase?

## ODD FOR IONWAVE

**IonWave has 88 sheets (v8) expanding to 842 (v11)**

This IS overdetermined documentation:
- Same concepts appear multiple places
- Validation happens across sheets
- Dependencies mapped
- Status tracked

**The challenge:** Make it navigable and maintainable

**The solution:** Orchestration system (we built this in Wave 1)
