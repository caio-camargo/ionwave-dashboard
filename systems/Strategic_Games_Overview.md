## WHAT ARE STRATEGIC GAMES

**Business is a series of games:**

Each "game" has:
- Players (competitors, customers, partners)
- Rules (regulations, norms, constraints)
- Winning conditions (what success looks like)
- Strategies (how to win)

**Key insight:** You can choose which games to play

## GAME SELECTION

**Not all games are worth playing:**

### Evaluate each game:
- **Winnable?** Can we actually win this game?
- **Worthwhile?** Is winning valuable?
- **Defensible?** Can we keep winning?
- **Aligned?** Does it fit our strategy?

**Best strategy:** Play games others aren't playing (create new games)

## GAME PHYSICS

**Every game has physics (how it works):**

### Discovery Questions:
- What are the rules (written and unwritten)?
- Who are the players?
- What strategies work?
- What strategies fail?
- How do you win?
- How do you lose?

**Map the physics before playing**
