# CSP-001 Case Study: HYP-006 (Organic & Referral Lift)

**Protocol**: CSP-001 (Constraint Scenario Protocol)
**Target Hypothesis**: HYP-006 — Organic & Referral Lift
**Date Executed**: 2026-02-06
**Executed By**: Caio, Claude (Session #6)
**Status**: Complete — pending registry integration

---

## 1. Target Hypothesis and Selection Rationale

**Selected**: HYP-006 — "10% of customer volume will come from organic/referral (unpaid) sources"

**Selection Criteria Applied**:
- **Primitive**: Yes (`depends_on: []`) — no upstream hypotheses to blame
- **Grade**: D (lowest possible — maximum hidden assumptions)
- **Impact Severity**: MEDIUM (but touches CRITICAL hypotheses through `mitigates: HYP-001`)
- **Constraint Scenario Coverage**: Touched by 3 of 4 scenarios (SC-02, SC-03, SC-04)

**Why This Hypothesis**: HYP-006 is the ideal first candidate because:
1. It's primitive — the analysis reveals things about the hypothesis itself, not about its dependencies
2. It's the weakest in the system (D-grade) — most likely to have hidden assumptions
3. It's framed as "passive upside" but three constraint scenarios stress it — suggesting it may be more important than currently understood
4. Testing here develops the CSP method on a safe target (MEDIUM severity) before applying to CRITICAL hypotheses

## 2. Applicable Scenarios and Tension Ratings

| Scenario | Constraint | Applies? | Tension | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| SC-01: $100M in 12 Months | Scale 1000x | LOW | At extreme scale, organic matters less (tiny % of massive paid) |
| SC-02: $100K MRR in 3 Months | 4x speed | **HIGH** | Speed compression demands every channel including organic |
| SC-03: $0 Marketing Budget | No paid channels | **CRITICAL** | Organic goes from 10% to 100% — existential |
| SC-04: 10 Hours/Week | Time constraint | **MEDIUM** | Forces organic to be systematic, not ad-hoc |

**Scenarios Applied**: SC-02 (HIGH), SC-03 (CRITICAL), SC-04 (MEDIUM)
**Scenario Skipped**: SC-01 (LOW tension — organic is rounding error at $100M scale)

---

## 3. Three-Question Drill Results

### Scenario 3: $0 Marketing Budget (CRITICAL tension)

*Applied first because it creates maximum tension — organic goes from supplementary to existential.*

#### Q1: What would have to be true?

1. Product quality so remarkable it generates spontaneous word-of-mouth
2. Content strategy capable of driving meaningful SEO traffic (thousands of visits/month)
3. Referral program with economics compelling enough to create viral loops
4. PR/earned media strategy generating coverage without paid amplification
5. Community dynamics within ICP segments (Keto/Carnivore) strong enough to carry awareness
6. Influencers willing to promote for free product only (no paid partnerships)

#### Q2: How could it possibly work?

| Condition | Mechanism | Currently Exists? |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Remarkable product | Marine plasma efficacy creates tangible, sharable results | NO — product untested |
| SEO traffic | Content targeting "best electrolytes", "LMNT alternative", "marine plasma benefits" | NO — no content strategy |
| Referral virality | Aggressive referral: give $20, get $20 (high enough to change behavior) | NO — no referral program designed |
| PR/earned media | Build-in-public on Twitter/YouTube; founder story angle; science/marine plasma angle | NO — no PR strategy |
| Community carry | Seed in Keto/Carnivore forums, Reddit, Facebook groups | NO — no community strategy |
| Free influencer promotion | Send free product to 50-100 micro-influencers, no payment | PARTIAL — on roadmap but unplanned |

**Gap Assessment**: 0 of 6 mechanisms currently exist. 1 is partially planned.

#### Q3: What does this reveal?

1. **HIDDEN ASSUMPTION**: HYP-006 assumes organic "just happens" — but every organic channel requires a specific mechanism that doesn't yet exist
2. **FRAMING PROBLEM**: The hypothesis treats organic as a single monolith (10%). In reality, it's 5+ distinct channels (referral, SEO, influencer, PR, WOM) each requiring different strategies, timelines, and investments
3. **CAPABILITY GAP**: The current plan has no content strategy, no referral program, no PR plan, no community strategy. Organic isn't just "undervalued" — it's unplanned
4. **RESILIENCE FUNCTION HIDDEN**: If paid acquisition hits problems (CPM spike, account suspension, category restriction), organic isn't just upside — it's the fallback. This resilience function is invisible in the current framing

---

### Scenario 2: $100K MRR in 3 Months (HIGH tension)

#### Q1: What would have to be true?

1. Pre-launch demand already built (5,000+ waitlist before Day 1)
2. Influencer launch campaign with coordinated same-day amplification (20+ influencers)
3. PR story that achieves viral reach (founder narrative, science angle, or controversy)
4. Referral coefficient > 1 (each customer brings > 1 new customer)
5. Organic contributes 30-40% of volume (not just 10%)

#### Q2: How could it possibly work?

| Condition | Mechanism | Currently Exists? |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Pre-launch waitlist | Landing page + lead magnet + community building pre-launch | NO — not planned |
| Influencer launch | Identify, negotiate, coordinate 20+ influencer posts on launch day | NO — not planned |
| Viral PR | Craft compelling narrative (AI-built company, marine plasma science, build-in-public) | PARTIAL — content exists but not packaged for PR |
| Referral coefficient > 1 | Subscription-only + aggressive referral + social sharing incentives | NO |
| Organic at 30-40% | All above mechanisms working simultaneously | NO |

#### Q3: What does this reveal?

1. **MISSING HYPOTHESIS EXPOSED**: There is no hypothesis for *pre-launch demand generation*. The current system assumes we go from zero to paid acquisition on Day 1. A pre-launch period that builds demand before capital deployment is a distinct, testable hypothesis
2. **TIMING DEPENDENCY HIDDEN**: Organic channels have fundamentally different ramp curves than paid. Paid: spend → immediate results. SEO: 3-6 months to rank. Referral: need customers before they can refer. Influencer: need product before seeding. The flat "10%" number hides a time-series problem
3. **RELATIONSHIP REFRAME**: HYP-006 is currently linked as `mitigates: HYP-001` (organic mitigates CAC pressure). But under speed compression, it's not mitigation — it's *acquisition portfolio diversification*. The relationship should be reconceived

---

### Scenario 4: 10 Hours/Week from Day 1 (MEDIUM tension)

#### Q1: What would have to be true?

1. Organic channels must be *systematic*, not ad-hoc (can't do manual community engagement at 10 hrs/week)
2. Content must be pre-built or AI-generated at scale
3. Referral must be automated (set up once, runs without intervention)
4. Influencer seeding must follow a playbook (VA can execute)

#### Q2: How could it possibly work?

| Condition | Mechanism | Currently Exists? |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Systematic organic | Documented playbooks for each organic channel with KPIs | NO |
| Scaled content | AI-generated SEO content pipeline (Claude writes, human reviews, publish) | NO |
| Automated referral | Shopify referral app, automated emails, self-serve portal | NO |
| Delegatable influencer outreach | VA playbook: find influencers → DM template → ship product → follow up | NO |

#### Q3: What does this reveal?

1. **AUTOMATION ASSUMPTION**: Even organic channels need operational infrastructure. "Organic" doesn't mean "free" — it means "not paid media." It still requires time, systems, and potentially money (referral credits, product sampling)
2. **DELEGATION DESIGN**: For the 10-hour target, every organic channel needs a playbook good enough for a VA to execute. This is a design requirement the hypothesis doesn't surface
3. **CONTENT INFRASTRUCTURE**: An AI content pipeline for SEO is a distinct capability that requires its own validation (does AI content rank? does it convert?)

## 4. Cross-Scenario Synthesis

### Recurring Conditions (appeared in 2+ scenarios)

| Condition | SC-02 | SC-03 | SC-04 | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| Referral program must exist and be effective | YES | YES | YES | **STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCY** — appears in all 3, must be a sub-hypothesis |
| Content/SEO strategy must be active | NO | YES | YES | Strong signal — needs sub-hypothesis |
| Influencer seeding must be planned | YES | YES | YES | Appears everywhere — needs sub-hypothesis |
| PR/earned media strategy needed | YES | YES | NO | Moderate signal — sub-hypothesis candidate |
| Pre-launch demand building | YES | NO | NO | New hypothesis, not sub-hypothesis |

### Contradictions

None found — scenarios are complementary rather than contradictory.

### Convergence

All three scenarios converge on the same core finding: **organic is not a single thing**. It's at minimum 5 distinct channels, each with different:
- Mechanisms (how it works)
- Timelines (when it works)
- Requirements (what you need for it to work)
- Validation methods (how you know it's working)

## 5. Sub-Hypothesis Decomposition

Based on the synthesis, HYP-006 decomposes into 5 sub-hypotheses:

| Sub-HYP | Name | Weight | Grade | Rationale |
|---------|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| HYP-006.1 | Referral Program Contribution | 0.35 | D | Appeared in all 3 scenarios. Highest-weight because most controllable and measurable. No program exists. |
| HYP-006.2 | SEO & Content Contribution | 0.25 | D | Appeared in 2 scenarios. Long ramp time (3-6 months). No strategy exists. |
| HYP-006.3 | Influencer Seeding Contribution | 0.20 | D | Appeared in all 3 scenarios. Moderate weight because partially planned. |
| HYP-006.4 | PR & Earned Media Contribution | 0.10 | D | Appeared in 2 scenarios. Lower weight because least controllable. |
| HYP-006.5 | Community & Word-of-Mouth | 0.10 | D | Implicit in all scenarios. Lowest weight because most dependent on product quality (not strategy). |

### Decomposition Detail

**HYP-006.1: Referral Program Contribution**
- **Claim**: Referral program will contribute 3-4% of total customer volume
- **Validation**: Launch referral program Month 2, track referral conversion rate over 60 days
- **Success**: ≥2% of customers come from referrals by Month 4
- **Kill**: <1% after 60 days of active referral program → referral is not a viable channel for this product

**HYP-006.2: SEO & Content Contribution**
- **Claim**: SEO/content will contribute 2-3% of total customer volume by Month 6
- **Validation**: Publish 20+ SEO articles in first 3 months, track organic traffic and conversion
- **Success**: ≥500 organic visits/month with ≥1% conversion rate by Month 6
- **Kill**: <100 organic visits/month after 20 articles published → content strategy not viable

**HYP-006.3: Influencer Seeding Contribution**
- **Claim**: Free product seeding to micro-influencers will contribute 2-3% of customer volume
- **Validation**: Send free product to 50 micro-influencers, track UTM codes and promo codes
- **Success**: ≥10 of 50 influencers post, generating ≥50 customers
- **Kill**: <5 of 50 post, or <10 customers generated → seeding not effective without payment

**HYP-006.4: PR & Earned Media Contribution**
- **Claim**: PR coverage will contribute 1-2% of customer volume in launch quarter
- **Validation**: Pitch 20+ media outlets, track coverage and attributed traffic
- **Success**: ≥3 articles published, generating measurable traffic spike
- **Kill**: <1 article after 20 pitches → story angle not compelling, need different approach

**HYP-006.5: Community & Word-of-Mouth**
- **Claim**: Organic WOM through communities (Reddit, Facebook groups, forums) will contribute 1-2% of volume
- **Validation**: Track "how did you hear about us" attribution, monitor brand mentions
- **Success**: ≥5% of customers cite "friend" or "community" in attribution survey
- **Kill**: <2% community attribution after 6 months → product doesn't generate organic conversation

## 6. Composite Score Calculation

**Before CSP (monolithic)**:
```
HYP-006: Grade D (single undifferentiated estimate)
```

**After CSP (decomposed)**:
```
HYP-006.1 Referral    (0.35 × D=1) = 0.35
HYP-006.2 SEO         (0.25 × D=1) = 0.25
HYP-006.3 Influencer  (0.20 × D=1) = 0.20
HYP-006.4 PR          (0.10 × D=1) = 0.10
HYP-006.5 WOM         (0.10 × D=1) = 0.10
                                     ------
Composite Score:                      1.00 → Grade D
```

**Grade unchanged** — but now the D is *diagnostic*. We know exactly which sub-components are weak and what would upgrade each one. The monolithic D was opaque; the decomposed D is actionable.

**Upgrade Path**:
- Validate HYP-006.1 (referral): D→B adds 0.70 to composite (→ 1.70, still D but close to C)
- Validate HYP-006.2 (SEO): D→C adds 0.25 (→ 1.95, solidly approaching C)
- Validate HYP-006.3 (influencer): D→B adds 0.40 (→ 2.35, Grade C)
- Full validation path: D → C in ~4 months, C → B in ~8 months

## 7. New Hypotheses Surfaced

### HYP-009 (Candidate): Pre-Launch Demand Generation

**Origin**: SC-02 (Q3, Finding 1) — the speed compression scenario exposed that the current system assumes zero-to-paid-acquisition on Day 1 with no pre-launch demand building.

**Proposed Hypothesis**:
- **ID**: HYP-009
- **Name**: Pre-Launch Demand Generation
- **Category**: growth
- **Description**: A pre-launch waitlist and community building campaign will generate 500+ qualified leads before paid acquisition begins
- **Impact Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH (reduces Day 1 CAC, provides initial organic base, creates social proof)
- **Current Grade**: D (not yet designed or executed)
- **Depends On**: [] (primitive)
- **Feeds Into**: HYP-001 (CAC — pre-launch demand reduces effective Day 1 CAC), HYP-006 (Organic — waitlist IS organic)

**Decision**: RECOMMEND CREATION — this is a genuinely missing component of the growth model. Creation to be executed in a subsequent session following Hypotheses Architecture Standards.

## 8. Relationship Graph Changes

### Changes Required

1. **HYP-006 → HYP-001 relationship reframe**:
   - **Before**: `related_hypotheses.mitigates: ["HYP-001"]` (organic mitigates CAC)
   - **After**: `related_hypotheses.portfolio_diversifies: ["HYP-001"]` (organic provides acquisition channel diversification, not just mitigation)
   - **Rationale**: SC-02 revealed that organic isn't a passive safety net — it's an active acquisition channel portfolio that reduces concentration risk on paid

2. **HYP-006 parent-child structure**:
   - Add `has_children: ["HYP-006.1", "HYP-006.2", "HYP-006.3", "HYP-006.4", "HYP-006.5"]` to HYP-006
   - Add `parent_id: "HYP-006"` to each sub-hypothesis
   - Add `composite_scoring: { method: "weighted", weights_sum_to: 1.0 }` to HYP-006

3. **New HYP-009 edges** (if created):
   - HYP-009 `feeds_into: ["HYP-001", "HYP-006"]`
   - HYP-001 `related_hypotheses.supported_by: ["HYP-009"]`
   - HYP-006 `related_hypotheses.accelerated_by: ["HYP-009"]`

---

## 9. Recommendations and Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session or Next)

1. **Register sub-hypotheses** HYP-006.1 through HYP-006.5 in `registry.json`
2. **Update HYP-006** with `has_children`, composite scoring metadata, and revision documenting decomposition
3. **Decide on HYP-009** (pre-launch demand) — create if approved

### Short-Term (Next 2-3 Sessions)

4. **Apply CSP to HYP-001 (CAC)** — the most CRITICAL primitive hypothesis. Expect decomposition into channel-specific CAC sub-hypotheses
5. **Apply CSP to HYP-003 (Churn)** — the D-grade CRITICAL hypothesis. Expect decomposition into churn-by-cohort and churn-by-reason
6. **Design referral program** (validates HYP-006.1) — the highest-weight sub-hypothesis

### Medium-Term (Before Validation Spending)

7. **Run CSP on all remaining primitive hypotheses** before deploying validation capital
8. **Build SEO content pipeline** (validates HYP-006.2) — longest lead time, start earliest
9. **Design pre-launch campaign** (validates HYP-009 if created)

### Protocol Improvement

10. **After 3 CSP runs**, review the protocol itself (Meta-Control): Are the steps right? Is anything missing? Is the composite scoring formula correct? Is the weighting approach sound?

---

## 10. Process Observations (Meta-Learning)

This being the first CSP run, some observations about the process itself:

1. **Scenario 3 ($0 budget) was the most revealing** — the constraint that removes the primary channel forces maximum creative thinking about alternatives. Consider applying "remove the primary mechanism" as a general diagnostic heuristic.

2. **The Three-Question Drill works well** — Q1 (necessary conditions) does the real analytical work. Q2 (mechanisms) is the reality check. Q3 (reveals) is where insight crystallizes. The ordering matters.

3. **Sub-hypothesis weighting is subjective** — the weights (0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.10) are estimates. They should be refined as validation data comes in. Consider making weight adjustment a Meta-Control parameter.

4. **"What does this reveal?" is the payoff question** — the first two questions are scaffolding. The reveals are where the actual value is generated. Spend the most time here.

5. **Cross-scenario synthesis finds structural dependencies** — if a condition appears in 3/3 scenarios, it's not scenario-specific. It's structural. This is the mechanism by which CSP discovers sub-hypotheses.
