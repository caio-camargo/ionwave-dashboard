# CSP-002 Case Study: HYP-003 (Monthly Subscriber Churn Rate)

**Protocol**: CSP-001 (Constraint Scenario Protocol)
**Run ID**: CSP-002
**Target Hypothesis**: HYP-003 — Monthly Subscriber Churn Rate
**Date Executed**: 2026-02-06
**Executed By**: Caio, Claude (Session #7)
**Status**: Complete — pending registry integration

## 1. Target Hypothesis and Selection Rationale

**Selected**: HYP-003 — "Subscriber churn will be ≤12% per month (average 8.3 month lifetime)"

**Selection Criteria Applied**:
- **Primitive**: Yes (`depends_on: []`) — no upstream hypotheses to blame
- **Grade**: D (lowest grade among untested primitives)
- **Impact Severity**: HIGH (but risk_if_wrong is CRITICAL — "15% churn reduces LTV from $159 to $64")
- **Constraint Scenario Coverage**: Touched by 4 of 4 scenarios (universal applicability)
- **System Position**: Weakest link — HYP-005 (LTV) cannot exceed D-grade while HYP-003 is D

**Why This Hypothesis**: HYP-003 is a silent killer:
1. Churn compounds — every month's loss reduces the base for next month's revenue
2. It's the weakest input to LTV (the most critical derived metric)
3. The registry explicitly notes "no retention strategy in place yet" and "marine plasma results timeline unclear"
4. It has 4 negative confidence factors and only 2 positive — heavily unbalanced
5. It's the last remaining D-grade primitive after HYP-006 was decomposed

## 2. Applicable Scenarios and Tension Ratings

| Scenario | Constraint | Applies? | Tension | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| SC-01: $100M in 12 Months | Scale 1000x | YES | **HIGH** | At scale, even 12% churn = $12M/month revenue loss requiring massive replacement |
| SC-02: $100K MRR in 3 Months | 4x speed | YES | **HIGH** | Speed compression makes every lost subscriber irreplaceable |
| SC-03: $0 Marketing Budget | No paid channels | YES | **CRITICAL** | Can't replace churned customers at all — churn tolerance drops to near-zero |
| SC-04: 10 Hours/Week | Time constraint | YES | **MEDIUM** | Retention must be automatic — can't manually save customers |

**All four scenarios apply** — churn is the universal tax on every business model variant. This is unique among hypotheses tested so far (HYP-006 only triggered 3 of 4).

**Execution order**: SC-03 (CRITICAL) → SC-02 (HIGH) → SC-01 (HIGH) → SC-04 (MEDIUM)

## 3. Three-Question Drill Results

### Scenario 3: $0 Marketing Budget (CRITICAL tension)

*With zero ability to replace churned subscribers, every customer is irreplaceable. Churn tolerance drops from 12% to near-zero.*

#### Q1: What would have to be true?

1. Product efficacy must be tangible and fast — customers must *feel* a difference within 14-30 days (before second billing cycle)
2. Onboarding must educate on expected timeline — if marine plasma takes 60 days to show results, customers need to know *before* they cancel at Day 30
3. Habit formation must be engineered — daily usage reminders, ritual building, consumption tracking
4. Cancellation friction must be optimized — save offers, pause options, downgrade tiers (value friction, not hostile friction)
5. Community belonging must create switching cost — customers in a community churn less (identity-based retention)
6. Subscription cadence must match consumption rate — if 30-day supply lasts 45 days, customer cancels because they don't need more yet

#### Q2: How could it possibly work?

| Condition | Mechanism | Currently Exists? |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Tangible results in 14-30 days | Formulation tuned for felt effects (energy, hydration, recovery) | **UNKNOWN** — formulation not tested on humans |
| Onboarding with timeline education | Email sequence: Day 1, 7, 14, 21, 30 with "what to expect" messaging | **NO** — no email sequences designed |
| Habit formation | Daily reminder (app/SMS), consumption tracker, streak rewards | **NO** — no retention system |
| Cancellation save flow | Pause option, skip-a-month, downsell to smaller size, "give us one more month" | **NO** — no save flow designed |
| Community switching cost | Private community (Slack/Discord/Facebook), user stories, accountability partners | **NO** — no community strategy |
| Consumption-cadence match | 30-day supply consumed in ~28-32 days (test with beta users) | **UNKNOWN** — no consumption data |

**Gap Assessment**: 0 of 6 mechanisms exist. 2 are unknowable until product is in customers' hands.

#### Q3: What does this reveal?

1. **HIDDEN ASSUMPTION — PRODUCT EFFICACY**: The entire churn hypothesis rests on product efficacy, which is completely untested. "12% churn" assumes the product works. If marine plasma doesn't produce tangible results fast enough, churn could be 25-30%. This is not a business hypothesis — it's a *product hypothesis* masquerading as a business one.

2. **HIDDEN ASSUMPTION — TIME-TO-VALUE**: Implicit assumption that customers feel benefits before the second billing cycle (~30 days). If time-to-value is 60-90 days (plausible for trace mineral supplementation), then churn in months 1-3 will be dramatically higher than the 12% steady-state. The hypothesis describes steady-state churn but ignores *early-life churn*.

3. **CAPABILITY GAP — RETENTION INFRASTRUCTURE**: Zero retention infrastructure exists. No onboarding emails, no save flows, no pause options, no community. Churn of 12% assumes these things exist. Without them, churn is probably 15-20%+ (industry benchmark for DTC supplements with no retention strategy).

4. **FRAMING PROBLEM**: "12% monthly churn" is a single number hiding a time-series reality. Churn follows a curve: high in months 1-2 (novelty fades), decreasing over time (remaining subscribers are loyal). The monolithic 12% masks critical early-life dynamics.

---

### Scenario 2: $100K MRR in 3 Months (HIGH tension)

#### Q1: What would have to be true?

1. First-month churn must be ≤8% — at speed, you can't afford average loss rates
2. Product must deliver a "wow moment" in Week 1 — not gradual benefits, something noticeable immediately
3. Subscription must be default with friction to cancel — subscription-first design is a retention strategy, not just attach strategy
4. Social proof must be abundant immediately — new subscribers need to see others thriving
5. Re-engagement must be automated and fast — if usage drops, intervention within 48 hours

#### Q2: How could it possibly work?

| Condition | Mechanism | Currently Exists? |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| ≤8% first-month churn | All mechanisms below working simultaneously | NO |
| Week 1 wow moment | Formulation emphasizing immediate felt effect + unboxing experience | UNKNOWN |
| Subscription-default | Shopify subscription app, one-time as explicit downgrade | NO |
| Immediate social proof | Pre-launch testimonials, influencer content, UGC campaign | NO |
| Fast re-engagement | Automated email/SMS triggered by usage drop signals | NO |

#### Q3: What does this reveal?

1. **TIMING DEPENDENCY**: Churn has fundamentally different character in Month 1 vs. Month 6. Early-life churn is the real risk, not steady-state. A customer who survives Month 3 is likely to stay — the battle is won or lost in the first 60 days.

2. **PRODUCT EXPERIENCE IS RETENTION**: Under speed pressure, churn is not a business operations problem — it's a product experience problem. The product must be *remarkable*, not just adequate.

3. **REFRAME — CHURN AS PMF SIGNAL**: At speed, high churn (>15%) is not a retention problem to solve — it's a product-market fit signal. Retention tactics (save flows, discounts) might mask this signal but can't fix it.

---

### Scenario 1: $100M Revenue in 12 Months (HIGH tension)

#### Q1: What would have to be true?

1. Churn must be ≤5% at scale — at $100M, 12% churn = $12M/month lost, requiring massive replacement
2. Multiple product SKUs — retention improves with breadth (customers switch within brand, not away)
3. Annual subscription options — lock in commitment to reduce month-to-month churn
4. Net Revenue Retention must exceed 100% — existing customers spend MORE over time

#### Q3: What does this reveal?

1. **MISSING CONCEPT — NET REVENUE RETENTION (NRR)**: Hypothesis is framed as *logo churn* (customers leaving). At scale, *revenue churn* matters more. If customers who stay spend more over time (larger orders, additional SKUs), NRR can exceed 100% even with some logo churn. Hypothesis should track both.

2. **SKU EXPANSION AS RETENTION LEVER**: Single-product company has higher churn than multi-product company. Future SKUs are a retention strategy, not just growth strategy.

---

### Scenario 4: 10 Hours/Week (MEDIUM tension)

#### Q1: What would have to be true?

1. Retention must be product-driven, not operations-driven — can't manually save customers at 10 hrs/week
2. Automated retention flows must handle 90%+ of at-risk customers
3. Product consumption must be self-sustaining — customers order because they run out, not because they're reminded

#### Q3: What does this reveal?

1. **AUTOMATION ASSUMPTION**: 12% churn implicitly assumes active retention management. Only automated retention matters under time constraint.

2. **PRODUCT-DRIVEN VS. OPERATIONS-DRIVEN RETENTION**: Fundamental design choice. Product-driven = so good people don't leave. Operations-driven = save flows and discounts keep them. The former scales; the latter doesn't. Hypothesis should specify which type drives the 12%.

---

## 4. Cross-Scenario Synthesis

### Recurring Conditions (appeared in 2+ scenarios)

| Condition | SC-01 | SC-02 | SC-03 | SC-04 | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| Product must deliver tangible results fast | — | YES | YES | YES | **STRUCTURAL** — foundation of all retention |
| Retention must be automated | — | YES | — | YES | Strong signal — manual retention doesn't scale |
| Onboarding must set expectations | — | YES | YES | — | Critical for early-life churn window |
| Community/identity creates switching costs | YES | — | YES | — | Second-order lever |
| Multiple SKUs improve retention | YES | — | — | — | Scale-dependent, not immediate priority |

### Contradictions

**Product-driven vs. Operations-driven retention**: SC-03/SC-04 say "product must do the work," while SC-02 implies "operations must save every customer." Resolution: *stage-dependent*. Early (learning phase): operations matter more. Later (scaled): product must carry it.

### Convergence

All four scenarios converge on **one core insight**: **the churn hypothesis is a product hypothesis in disguise**.

"12% monthly churn" is really a claim that:
1. The product delivers tangible results fast enough that people don't cancel
2. The subscription cadence matches consumption rate
3. Enough retention infrastructure exists to save wavering customers
4. Early-life churn (Month 1-3) is manageable despite novelty fading

These are four distinct claims requiring different evidence and different interventions.

## 5. Sub-Hypothesis Decomposition

Based on the synthesis, HYP-003 decomposes into 4 sub-hypotheses:

| Sub-HYP | Name | Weight | Grade | Rationale |
|---------|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| HYP-003.1 | Product Efficacy & Time-to-Value | 0.40 | D | Appeared in 3/4 scenarios. Highest weight: everything else is moot if product doesn't work. Completely untested. |
| HYP-003.2 | Early-Life Churn (Month 1-3) | 0.30 | D | The kill zone. If customers don't survive months 1-3, steady-state is irrelevant. No onboarding designed. |
| HYP-003.3 | Retention Infrastructure | 0.20 | D | Save flows, pause, re-engagement. None exist. Lower weight: operations-driven, less scalable. |
| HYP-003.4 | Consumption-Cadence Match | 0.10 | D | Subscription timing must match usage rate. Unknown until real customers use product. |

### Decomposition Detail

**HYP-003.1: Product Efficacy & Time-to-Value**
- **Claim**: Marine plasma supplementation produces tangible, felt results within 14-30 days of daily use
- **Validation**: Beta test with 20-30 users. Daily symptom tracking (energy, hydration, recovery, focus). Pre/post surveys at Day 7, 14, 30
- **Success**: ≥60% of beta users report noticeable improvement by Day 30
- **Kill**: <30% report any noticeable change by Day 30 → product doesn't deliver perceived value, churn will be catastrophic
- **Critical Note**: Arguably the most important hypothesis in the entire system. Everything downstream depends on it.

**HYP-003.2: Early-Life Churn (Month 1-3)**
- **Claim**: Month 1-3 churn will be ≤15% per month (higher than steady-state but survivable), declining monthly
- **Validation**: Track cohort-level churn by month. Design onboarding email sequence with expectation-setting. Measure "time to first reorder"
- **Success**: Month 1 churn ≤15%, Month 2 ≤12%, Month 3 ≤10% (declining curve)
- **Kill**: Month 1 churn >25% or Month 2 churn not declining → product or positioning problem, not a retention problem

**HYP-003.3: Retention Infrastructure Effectiveness**
- **Claim**: Automated retention flows will recover 20-30% of at-risk churners
- **Validation**: Build save flow in Shopify, measure recovery rate on cancellation attempts
- **Success**: ≥20% of cancellation attempts saved (paused, downsold, or given one more month)
- **Kill**: <10% save rate after 60 days → save flow ineffective, churn is a product problem not an operations problem

**HYP-003.4: Consumption-Cadence Match**
- **Claim**: 30-day subscription cadence matches actual consumption rate within ±5 days
- **Validation**: Survey first 50 subscribers: "When did you run out?" Compare to billing cycle
- **Success**: ≥70% of customers consume product within 25-35 day window
- **Kill**: Median consumption >40 days → product lasts too long, customers accumulate surplus and cancel

## 6. Composite Score Calculation

**Before CSP (monolithic)**:
```
HYP-003: Grade D (single undifferentiated estimate)
```

**After CSP (decomposed)**:
```
HYP-003.1 Efficacy        (0.40 × D=1) = 0.40
HYP-003.2 Early-Life      (0.30 × D=1) = 0.30
HYP-003.3 Infrastructure  (0.20 × D=1) = 0.20
HYP-003.4 Cadence Match   (0.10 × D=1) = 0.10
                                         ------
Composite Score:                          1.00 → Grade D
```

**Upgrade Path**:
- Validate HYP-003.1 (efficacy beta test): D→C adds 0.40 → composite 1.40 (D, but approaching C)
- Validate HYP-003.2 (first cohort survives): D→C adds 0.30 → composite 1.70 (Grade C!)
- Build HYP-003.3 (save flows): D→C adds 0.20 → composite 1.90 (solidly C)
- **Key insight**: Upgrading HYP-003 to C requires efficacy + surviving early-life churn. Both are Month 1-3 activities.

## 7. New Hypotheses Surfaced

**No new standalone hypothesis needed**, but:

1. **Strengthens HYP-009 case** (Pre-Launch Demand Generation, surfaced in CSP-001 HYP-006 run): Beta testing product efficacy (HYP-003.1 validation) can double as pre-launch demand building — beta testers become first advocates.

2. **New concept surfaced — Net Revenue Retention**: SC-01 revealed that logo churn and revenue churn are different metrics. At scale, NRR matters more. This doesn't require a new hypothesis now but should be added when the business reaches scale (>$50K MRR).

---

## 8. Relationship Graph Changes

### Changes Required

1. **HYP-003 parent-child structure**:
   - Add `has_children: ["HYP-003.1", "HYP-003.2", "HYP-003.3", "HYP-003.4"]`
   - Add `composite_scoring: { method: "weighted", weights_sum_to: 1.0 }`

2. **Cross-hypothesis sub-link**:
   - HYP-006.5 (Community & WOM) should add `depends_on: ["HYP-003.1"]`
   - Word-of-mouth requires product efficacy — no efficacy, no WOM
   - This is the first *sub-hypothesis cross-link* in the system

3. **HYP-003 → HYP-005 mechanism clarification**:
   - Existing relationship confirmed, but the *mechanism* is now known: HYP-003.1 (efficacy) and HYP-003.2 (early-life churn) are the primary drivers of LTV, not the steady-state 12% number

---

## 9. Recommendations and Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Before Anything Else)

1. **HYP-003.1 is the single most important hypothesis to validate** — product efficacy determines everything. Run a beta test with 20-30 real users tracking daily symptoms before any other capital deployment.
   - This is a **pre-launch activity** that costs only product samples + time
   - It validates the foundation that all other hypotheses rest on
   - If it fails (<30% feel anything), every other hypothesis is moot

### Short-Term (Month 1-2)

2. **Design onboarding email sequence** (addresses HYP-003.2) — expectation-setting for marine plasma results timeline
3. **Build Shopify save flow** (addresses HYP-003.3) — pause, downsell, "one more month" options
4. **Survey beta testers on consumption rate** (addresses HYP-003.4) — how long does a 30-day supply actually last?

### Protocol Improvement Notes

5. **New diagnostic question for CSP**: "Is this a time-series hypothesis?" — if yes, decompose into temporal phases (early-life vs. steady-state). Added to meta-learning for protocol revision.
6. **Cross-hypothesis sub-links are emerging** — the protocol should explicitly check for these in Step 8.

---

## 10. Process Observations (Meta-Learning)

1. **HYP-003 hit "UNKNOWN" repeatedly** — unlike HYP-006 (which could be decomposed from logic alone), churn keeps running into "product not tested." This suggests a class of hypotheses that **cannot be further analyzed without empirical data**. The CSP still added value (it identified *what* needs testing), but the decomposition is more about validation sequencing than strategic insight.

2. **The 40% weight on product efficacy is the single most consequential finding across both CSP runs.** HYP-003.1 is arguably the most important hypothesis in the entire system. If marine plasma doesn't produce felt results fast enough, churn will be catastrophic, LTV will collapse, CAC will be unrecoverable, and the business fails. This should be tested *before* everything else.

3. **"Churn is a product hypothesis in disguise"** is the key strategic reframe. The current system treats churn as a business operations metric. The CSP reveals it's a product quality metric. This reframes where to spend effort: not on save flows and discounts, but on product formulation and user experience.

4. **Cross-hypothesis sub-links are valuable but complex.** HYP-003.1 → HYP-006.5 creates a richer dependency graph, but also increases system complexity. Monitor whether this adds clarity or confusion.

5. **Early-life vs. steady-state churn** is a framework-level insight that should be incorporated into the CSP protocol itself as a standard diagnostic question. See Recommendation #5.
