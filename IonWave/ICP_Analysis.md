## SECTION 1: MAIN CONTENT

### 1.1 Primary ICP — Validated

**Profile:** Male, 28-45, $100K+ HHI, biohacker/optimizer mindset, already takes supplements, has tried LMNT/Drip Drop/similar. Found on YouTube (Huberman, Attia clips), podcasts, Reddit (r/keto, r/biohackers, r/supplements), Twitter/X health communities.

**Core Pain:** Knows current electrolyte powders use synthetic ingredients and excessive sodium. Wants something cleaner, more scientifically grounded, and aligned with their identity as someone who optimizes.

**"Not the ICP" (strategic discipline):** General fitness casuals, price shoppers (<$1/serving threshold), people who need education on what electrolytes are. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A ICP sheet — clear exclusion criteria; validated by Porter's Force 2 (HIGH buyer power = price shoppers are structurally unprofitable)]

[Confidence for Primary ICP: B | Source: 03A ICP sheet + partial validation from 03B LMNT VOC themes. Upgrade path: conduct 5-10 IonWave-specific customer interviews to confirm marine plasma resonance with this profile]

### 1.2 Consolidated Psychographic Profiles (Sheets 4+5 merged)

The original 03A contained two overlapping psychographic profile sheets with different structures. Below is the consolidated version, merging unique fields from both.

---

#### Profile 1: THE OPTIMIZER / BIOHACKER

**Identity:** High performer who treats health as a system to optimize. Tech/finance professional, 30-50. Experiments constantly with supplements, diet, sleep protocols.

**Beliefs:** The body is a system that can be measured, tuned, and improved. Mainstream health advice is generic and insufficient. Data > anecdote. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheets 4+5, consistent across both versions]

**Fears:** Leaving performance on the table. Declining cognitive function. Being average. Taking something suboptimal when something better exists. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 4 (fears) + Sheet 5 (fears)]

**Desires:** Measurable improvement in energy, cognition, recovery. The BEST product, not just a good one. Peer recognition as someone who knows their stuff. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheets 4+5]

**Worldview:** Science and data over tradition. Willing to pay premium for what's provably better. Skeptical of marketing claims — demands evidence. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 4]

**Triggers:** Discovers a gap in their stack. Reads about a new ingredient with research backing. Podcast mention by trusted authority (Huberman, Attia). [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 4 + 01_Strategic_Foundation Thesis sheet]

**Objections:** "How is this different from what I'm already taking?" "Where's the published research?" "Is marine plasma actually better or is this marketing?" [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 4]

**Language They Use:** "stack", "protocol", "biomarkers", "HRV", "N=1 experiment", "optimizing", "clean keto" [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 5 — unique to this version, high value for ad copy]

**VOC Cross-Reference:**
- LMNT-031 confirms this persona exists: "The biohacking community at r/biohackers treats it like liquid gold" [Confidence: A | Source: 03B v1.0.1]
- LMNT-009 shows the functional job: "I'm a salty sweater. This is the only thing that prevents cramping during hot yoga" [Confidence: B | Source: 03B v1.0.1, needs manual verification]
- Pain-Taste theme (6 quotes) suggests this persona tolerates saltiness as a signal of efficacy but would prefer a more refined formulation

**JTBD Mapping:**
- **Functional job:** "I need to maintain peak cognitive and physical performance throughout the day without energy dips or cramps" [Confidence: B | Source: JTBD framework applied to 03A + 03B evidence]
- **Emotional job:** "I want to feel like I've found the ultimate product — the one most people don't know about yet" [Confidence: C | Source: Inference from archetype behavior patterns; no direct VOC quote]
- **Social job:** "I want to signal that I'm ahead of the curve — I use marine plasma, not the mass-market stuff" [Confidence: C | Source: Inference from 03A archetype + Porter's sub-segment positioning analysis]

---

#### Profile 2: THE KETO / CARNIVORE DIETER

**Identity:** Health rebel on a strict low-carb or carnivore protocol. Believes mainstream nutrition is wrong and ancestral/natural approaches are correct. Community-driven — active in online forums.

**Beliefs:** Mainstream nutrition advice (food pyramid, low-fat) caused the health crisis. Ancestral diets are the answer. Clean ingredients matter — if it's processed, it's suspect. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheets 4+5]

**Fears:** Keto flu. Failing at the diet due to electrolyte imbalance. Going back to feeling how they felt before keto. Accidentally consuming something that breaks ketosis or contains hidden carbs/sugars. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheets 4+5; strongly validated by VOC]

**Desires:** Feel great during fasting and keto without overthinking supplementation. Clean, transparent, ancestrally-aligned products. Community belonging with others on the same path. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheets 4+5]

**Worldview:** Contrarian — if the mainstream recommends it, it's probably wrong. Values transparency, ingredient purity, and "natural" sourcing. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 4]

**Triggers:** Starting keto and feeling awful (keto flu). Reading about electrolyte importance in a keto community. A trusted community member's recommendation. LMNT maltodextrin revelation. [Confidence: B for first three, D for maltodextrin trigger | Sources: 03A Sheet 4; Porter's Analysis Force 5 re: lawsuits]

**Objections:** "Why can't I just use salt?" "Is this actually keto-friendly or are you hiding ingredients like LMNT?" [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 4; DIY objection validated by Porter's Force 4]

**Language They Use:** "clean keto", "mineral balance", "electrolytes", "keto flu", "carnivore", "ancestral" [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 5]

**VOC Cross-Reference:**
- LMNT-007: "Killed my keto flu symptoms in one day. Worth every penny." — Directly validates the functional job [Confidence: B | Source: 03B v1.0.1, quoted secondhand]
- LMNT-010: "I've now got off the blood pressure medicine... all because my electrolytes are balanced." — Validates the health transformation desire [Confidence: A | Source: 03B v1.0.1, directly verified]
- LMNT-031: "The r/ketogains and r/running communities generally love it" — Confirms community-driven purchase behavior [Confidence: A | Source: 03B v1.0.1]
- Pain-Taste theme (6 quotes) is relevant: keto dieters are accustomed to adjusting taste/texture and may tolerate it, but a better-tasting marine plasma product has clear positioning

**JTBD Mapping:**
- **Functional job:** "I need to prevent keto flu and maintain electrolyte balance on my restricted diet without consuming anything that breaks ketosis" [Confidence: A | Source: Strong VOC validation — LMNT-007, LMNT-010, LMNT-013]
- **Emotional job:** "I want to feel like I'm doing keto RIGHT — not just surviving it but thriving" [Confidence: B | Source: 03A archetype + "Fasting Fiona" persona parallels]
- **Social job:** "I want to belong to the community of people doing keto the smart way — not the mainstream supplement crowd" [Confidence: B | Source: Community-driven behavior evident in 03B VOC Reddit/FB sources]

---

#### Profile 3: THE EXHAUSTED PROFESSIONAL

**Identity:** Successful but struggling. Has the income to spend on solutions but not the time or energy to research everything. Looking for "just works" answers.

**Beliefs:** Health shouldn't be this complicated. Willing to pay for convenience and trust. Something is wrong — maybe it's nutrition, maybe it's stress, maybe it's aging. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheets 4+5]

**Fears:** Burnout. Energy crashes that impact work performance. Not being able to keep up. Becoming dependent on caffeine. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheets 4+5]

**Desires:** Sustained energy throughout the day without caffeine dependency. A simple, credible product that doesn't require research to trust. "Just tell me what to take." [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheets 4+5]

**Worldview:** Too busy to figure everything out. Will trust authority figures and premium branding as shortcuts to decision-making. Values convenience over optimization. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 4]

**Triggers:** Hit a wall — doctor couldn't help, or bloodwork came back "normal" but they still feel terrible. A colleague or podcast host mentions electrolytes as a fix. Afternoon energy crash becomes unbearable. [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 4]

**Objections:** "I've tried everything." "I don't have time to research another supplement." "How do I know this isn't just another fad?" [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 4]

**Language They Use:** "energy", "focus", "afternoon slump", "brain fog", "burnout", "crash" [Confidence: B | Source: 03A Sheet 5]

**VOC Cross-Reference:**
- LMNT-029: "The morning grogginess lifted faster, and that desperate need for caffeine became less desperate." — Directly validates the functional job [Confidence: A | Source: 03B v1.0.1, verified]
- LMNT-011: "Since incorporating this electrolyte powder into my morning water routine, I have noticed a significant improvement in my overall energy levels." — Validates energy improvement [Confidence: A | Source: 03B v1.0.1, verified]
- Pain-Price theme: this persona has high willingness-to-pay. LMNT-014: "At first, I hesitated at the price, but the health benefits and convenience make it worth every penny." [Confidence: A | Source: 03B v1.0.1, verified]

**JTBD Mapping:**
- **Functional job:** "I need sustained energy and mental clarity throughout my workday without relying on more caffeine" [Confidence: A | Source: Strong VOC validation — LMNT-029, LMNT-011]
- **Emotional job:** "I want to feel like I'm taking care of myself — one simple, high-quality thing that actually works" [Confidence: B | Source: 03A archetype + VOC energy improvement quotes]
- **Social job:** "I want to be the person who has it together — including their health — without being 'a supplement bro'" [Confidence: C | Source: Inference from "Weekend Warrior Will" archetype + professional identity]

### 1.3 Customer Archetypes — VOC Validation Matrix

The 5 archetypes from 03A Sheet 1 map to the 3 psychographic profiles above. Below is the validation status of each archetype against 03B VOC evidence.

| Archetype | Maps to Profile | VOC Evidence? | Validation Status | Key Quote |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Keto Kevin (M 35-45, strict keto) | Keto/Carnivore Dieter | ✅ Strong | **VALIDATED** — 7+ relevant quotes across keto flu, effectiveness, community themes | LMNT-007: "Killed my keto flu symptoms in one day" |
| CrossFit Claire (F 28-38, paleo-ish) | Overlaps Optimizer + Keto | ⚠️ Partial | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** — effectiveness quotes cover workout performance but no CrossFit-specific VOC | LMNT-012: "Fewer dips in energy, reduced post-run fatigue" |
| Biohacker Ben (M 30-50, optimizer) | Optimizer/Biohacker | ✅ Moderate | **VALIDATED** — biohacker community evidence + effectiveness praise | LMNT-031: "r/biohackers treats it like liquid gold" |
| Fasting Fiona (F 35-55, IF) | Keto/Carnivore Dieter (subset) | ⚠️ Partial | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** — fasting is mentioned but VOC evidence is thin on fasting-specific jobs | LMNT-016: "nausea when using it fasted" (pain point, not validation of persona) |
| Weekend Warrior Will (M 30-45, casual) | Exhausted Professional (adjacent) | ❌ Weak | **UNVALIDATED** — no VOC evidence for casual/non-optimizer electrolyte users | None — this persona may be outside the marine plasma addressable market |

**Key Finding:** Three of five archetypes have meaningful VOC support. Fasting Fiona is plausible but thin on evidence. Weekend Warrior Will may not be a viable ICP for marine plasma specifically — he's price-sensitive, not identity-driven, and Porter's analysis shows the DIY substitute threat is highest for this segment. [Confidence: B | Source: Cross-analysis of 03A archetypes vs 03B VOC themes]

---

### 1.4 Secondary ICPs — Assessment

| Secondary ICP | From 03A | VOC Support | Porter's Alignment | Assessment |
|---------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| Keto/Carnivore | Lower price sensitivity, community-driven | ✅ Strong (multiple keto-specific VOC quotes) | ✅ Aligns with sub-segment positioning | **RETAIN — strongest secondary ICP** |
| Female Wellness 35-50 | "Underserved by current marine plasma brands" | ⚠️ Partial — LMNT-005 (pregnancy), LMNT-013 (pregnant/keto) show female users but not wellness-specific | ⚠️ Neutral — no Porter's data on this segment | **RETAIN but needs validation** — promising but assertion-only |
| Endurance Athletes | High volume, subscription-friendly | ⚠️ Partial — LMNT-008, LMNT-012 show endurance use | ✅ High substitute barrier for marine plasma vs synthetic in performance context | **RETAIN** — viable but competes directly with LMNT's strongest positioning |
| Chronic Fatigue/Autoimmune | High LTV, strong word-of-mouth | ❌ Weak — LMNT-010 touches health recovery but no autoimmune-specific evidence | ⚠️ Regulatory risk — health claims in supplements invite FTC scrutiny (per Porter's Force 1) | **FLAG — high risk/high reward** — could be powerful but making health claims is dangerous |

[Confidence: C overall | Source: Cross-analysis of 03A secondary ICPs vs 03B VOC + Porter's analysis; no primary IonWave customer data exists yet]

---

### 1.5 Lifecycle Segmentation & RFM Matrix — Assessment

**Lifecycle Segmentation (Sheet 2):** 8 segments from Prospects through Churned with strategies and automation triggers. This is **well-designed and actionable** for a post-launch CRM setup.

[Confidence: B for framework quality | No confidence grade possible for size targets (30-40% prospects, etc.) — these are industry benchmarks, not IonWave data. Status: Framework ready, data empty]

**RFM Segmentation Matrix (Sheet 3):** 10 segments with strategies. Quantitative columns (Count, %, Revenue %, LTV) are empty.

[Confidence: B for framework quality | Status: Template only — requires 3-6 months of sales data to populate. Track B.]

### 1.6 JTBD Summary — Jobs the Market Hires Electrolytes For

Per ci-protocol/07_FRAMEWORKS.md, the electrolyte market has at least 4 distinct jobs. Below is IonWave's position on each:

| Job | Description | LMNT Dominance | IonWave Opportunity | VOC Evidence |
|-----|-------------|----------------|--------------------|----|
| **Fasting Support** | "Don't crash during IF" | HIGH — LMNT owns this via Huberman/Rogan | MODERATE — marine plasma + zero-additive positioning can compete | LMNT-007, LMNT-016 (fasted nausea = opening) |
| **Workout Recovery** | "Bounce back faster after training" | HIGH — LMNT owns via CrossFit/running communities | LOW-MODERATE — would compete head-to-head | LMNT-008, LMNT-009, LMNT-012 |
| **Daily Wellness / Energy** | "Feel better throughout the day without more caffeine" | MODERATE — LMNT positions as sport/fasting, not daily wellness | **HIGH — this is IonWave's opening** | LMNT-011, LMNT-029 (morning routine, energy levels) |
| **Health Identity** | "I'm the kind of person who optimizes" | HIGH — LMNT brand equity is strong | MODERATE — marine plasma = "I go beyond LMNT" | LMNT-031 (biohacker community) |

**Strategic Implication:** LMNT dominates Jobs 1 and 2 (fasting + workout). IonWave's most promising *hypothesis to test first* is **Job 3 (Daily Wellness / Energy)** — this is the job where LMNT is least positioned and where the Exhausted Professional persona lives. The marine plasma story (78 minerals, oceanic origin, holistic wellness) maps better to daily wellness than to sports recovery.

This aligns with Porter's sub-segment recommendation: don't compete in "electrolytes for athletes" (LMNT's territory), compete in "marine mineral wellness" (unclaimed territory).

**Critical distinction (from persona dialogue ICP-2026-02-04-001):**
- **Job validation** [Confidence: B]: The functional jobs above are real — LMNT customers demonstrate them. VOC evidence is strong.
- **Switch trigger validation** [Confidence: D]: No evidence that "marine plasma" specifically motivates switching from current solutions. Customers have validated JOBS but not the REASON TO SWITCH to IonWave specifically.
- **Market size for Job 3** [Confidence: D]: LMNT's non-pursuit of daily wellness positioning could signal either (a) niche viability below LMNT's growth targets but sufficient for IonWave, or (b) market non-existence. Unvalidated.

[Confidence: B for job identification, D for switch triggers and Job 3 market size | Source: JTBD framework + persona dialogue stress-test]

## SECTION 2: INTELLIGENCE GAPS

### Gap 1: No IonWave-Specific Customer Data
**What We Estimate:** That the 03A personas accurately represent IonWave's future customer base
**Source of Estimate:** Inference from LMNT customer voice data + archetype construction (no primary IonWave research conducted)
**Confidence:** C

**Why This Matters:** Every persona and archetype in 03A is constructed from (a) category knowledge, (b) LMNT customer data, and (c) assumptions about marine plasma appeal. Zero data comes from actual IonWave customers or even marine plasma users. The personas may be right, but they're hypotheses, not validated profiles.

**Impact If Wrong:**
- **Optimistic:** If IonWave's actual customers match the Optimizer and Keto profiles, the personas are useful as-is
- **Pessimistic:** If marine plasma attracts a different customer type (e.g., integrative medicine patients, older wellness seekers), the archetypes are misleading and marketing will target the wrong people

**How to Validate:**
1. Conduct 5-10 exploratory interviews with marine plasma users (search Biocean/Quinton review communities, Seaonic customers) — 4-6 hours [Track A: research + Track B: interview execution]
2. After IonWave launch, run post-purchase surveys within first 30 days — ongoing [Track B]
3. Monitor Reddit/community engagement to see which persona types self-select — ongoing [Track A]

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks for pre-launch research; ongoing post-launch
**Priority:** **HIGH** — affects all downstream messaging, creative, and channel decisions

---

### Gap 2: Weekend Warrior Will — Unvalidated Archetype
**What We Estimate:** That casual athletes represent a viable ICP segment for marine plasma
**Source of Estimate:** 03A archetype construction (no VOC support)
**Confidence:** D

**Why This Matters:** Weekend Warrior Will is the only archetype with zero VOC validation. His profile (moderate income, "not a supplement guy", wants simplicity) conflicts with the marine plasma positioning (premium, specialty ingredient, optimizer identity). Porter's substitute analysis shows this persona has the highest DIY risk (price-sensitive, low brand loyalty).

**Impact If Wrong:**
- **Optimistic:** Dropping this archetype narrows focus to more viable segments, improving marketing efficiency
- **Pessimistic:** If this persona represents a large untapped market, ignoring them leaves revenue on the table

**How to Validate:**
1. Test marine plasma messaging with casual fitness audiences (A/B test ads targeting broader fitness vs optimizer audiences) — post-launch [Track B]
2. Interview 3-5 casual athletes about their electrolyte awareness and willingness-to-pay for marine plasma — 2-3 hours [Track B]

**Timeline:** Post-launch (not blocking)
**Priority:** **MEDIUM** — de-prioritize for launch; revisit after primary ICP is validated

---

### Gap 3: Female Wellness Secondary ICP — Assertion Only
**What We Estimate:** That women 35-50 interested in holistic wellness are underserved by marine plasma brands
**Source of Estimate:** 03A ICP sheet assertion; LMNT-005 and LMNT-013 show female users but in pregnancy/keto context, not general wellness
**Confidence:** D

**Why This Matters:** If female wellness is a genuine underserved segment for marine plasma, it could be IonWave's second beachhead after male biohackers. But the claim is currently unsupported — no dedicated VOC research, no community evidence, no competitor analysis of this segment.

**Impact If Wrong:**
- **Optimistic:** Female wellness is a $40B+ market; even a small slice is transformative
- **Pessimistic:** Chasing this segment too early dilutes focus and splits marketing budget

**How to Validate:**
1. Research Seaonic's customer demographics (Instagram followers, review profiles, testimonial gender split) — 1-2 hours [Track A]
2. Search wellness communities (MindBodyGreen, goop forums, women's health subreddits) for marine plasma / Quinton interest — 1-2 hours [Track A]
3. Analyze Biocean/Quinton customer reviews for gender and use-case patterns — 1 hour [Track A]

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks (Track A — Claude can execute)
**Priority:** **HIGH** — low-cost research with potentially high payoff; can be done before launch

---

### Gap 4: Fasting Fiona — Thin Evidence
**What We Estimate:** That fasting practitioners represent a distinct ICP segment (separate from keto)
**Source of Estimate:** 03A archetype; one relevant VOC quote (LMNT-016, fasted nausea — actually a pain point, not validation)
**Confidence:** C

**Why This Matters:** Fasting is growing rapidly (IF market expected to reach $150B+ by 2030). If fasting practitioners have distinct needs from keto dieters (which they might — fasting is about timing, keto is about macros), there may be a dedicated positioning play. But current evidence doesn't distinguish them.

**Impact If Wrong:**
- **Optimistic:** Fasting is a subset of Keto/Carnivore and doesn't need separate treatment
- **Pessimistic:** Fasting practitioners have unique needs (e.g., won't-break-fast guarantee, empty-stomach tolerance) that generic keto messaging misses

**How to Validate:**
1. Collect 10-15 VOC quotes specifically from fasting communities (r/intermittentfasting, r/fasting, fasting-specific YouTube comments) — 2-3 hours [Track A]
2. Apply saturation methodology to determine if fasting jobs are distinct from keto jobs — during collection [Track A]

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours (Track A)
**Priority:** **MEDIUM** — quick research task that could sharpen positioning

---

### Gap 5: Chronic Fatigue/Autoimmune — Regulatory Risk Unquantified
**What We Estimate:** That health-challenged customers represent a high-LTV ICP with word-of-mouth potential
**Source of Estimate:** 03A ICP sheet assertion
**Confidence:** D

**Why This Matters:** This segment is high-risk/high-reward. The LTV could be extraordinary (daily use, subscription-sticky, passionate word-of-mouth). But making or implying health claims for supplements triggers FTC scrutiny — exactly the issue LMNT faces with its maltodextrin lawsuits. Porter's analysis (Force 1, regulatory) flags this risk.

**Impact If Wrong:**
- **Optimistic:** IonWave attracts this segment organically through product quality without making claims
- **Pessimistic:** Marketing to this segment explicitly invites regulatory action that could threaten the entire brand

**How to Validate:**
1. Review FTC enforcement history for supplement health claims — 1-2 hours [Track A]
2. Research how Quinton/Biocean handle health-related marketing in their clinical channel — 1 hour [Track A]
3. Consult with a supplement-focused attorney before any marketing targeting this segment — [Track B, human]

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for research; legal consultation before launch
**Priority:** **MEDIUM** — research now, act later. Do not target this segment at launch without legal guidance.

## SECTION 3: SCORECARD

### Confidence Overview

| Component | Grade | Key Limitation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Primary ICP | B | No IonWave-specific customer data; validated via LMNT proxy only |
| Optimizer/Biohacker Profile | B | VOC confirms persona exists; JTBD social job is inferred (C) |
| Keto/Carnivore Profile | B+ | Strongest VOC validation (7+ quotes); JTBD functional job at A |
| Exhausted Professional Profile | B | Good VOC support for energy/wellness job; needs marine plasma-specific validation |
| Customer Archetypes | B- | 3 of 5 validated; Fasting Fiona partial; Weekend Warrior unvalidated |
| Secondary ICPs | C | All are assertions; Keto/Carnivore strongest, rest need research |
| JTBD Analysis | B | Framework applied; Job 3 (Daily Wellness) opening is well-supported but untested |
| Lifecycle Segmentation | B (framework) / N/A (data) | Framework sound; zero customer data to populate |
| **Overall** | **B** | Proxy-validated via LMNT data; persona dialogue stress-tested (4 upgrades applied). Key limitation: jobs validated but switch triggers unvalidated |

### Top Strategic Implications

1. **Job 3 (Daily Wellness / Energy) is the most promising hypothesis to test first, not a validated opening.** LMNT dominates fasting and workout. The Exhausted Professional persona has VOC support for the *job* but not for the *switch trigger* to marine plasma specifically. Additionally, the Exhausted Professional has the lowest WTP ($1.00-1.50/serving) of primary segments — creating a **positioning-economics tension** where the strategically strongest segment may not be the most margin-positive. This tension must be resolved against 06_Unit_Economics before committing resources. (Upgraded by persona dialogue ICP-2026-02-04-001)

2. **Weekend Warrior Will: insufficient data to validate — defer decision until Seaonic customer research.** Zero VOC validation in LMNT dataset, but VOC dataset is 100% LMNT customers. Casual athletes may buy Seaonic/Quinton and those voices weren't captured. Research Seaonic customer demographics before dropping this archetype. (Upgraded by persona dialogue ICP-2026-02-04-001)

3. **Female Wellness is the highest-upside research gap.** Low-cost Track A research (Seaonic demographics, wellness community search) could reveal whether this is a genuine underserved segment or an assumption. If validated, it becomes IonWave's second beachhead after male biohackers.

### Upgrade Shopping List (Prioritized)

| Priority | Task | Time | Track | Expected Outcome |
|----------|------|------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Research Female Wellness secondary ICP (Seaonic demographics, wellness communities, Quinton reviews) | 3-4 hours | A | Secondary ICP: D → B; confirm or kill female wellness hypothesis |
| 2 | Collect fasting-specific VOC (r/intermittentfasting, r/fasting, fasting YouTube) | 2-3 hours | A | Fasting Fiona: C → B; determine if fasting is distinct job or keto subset |
| 3 | Conduct 5-10 marine plasma user interviews (Biocean/Quinton reviewers, Seaonic customers) | 4-6 hours research + outreach | A+B | Primary ICP: C → B+; first IonWave-specific customer data |
| 4 | Research FTC enforcement on supplement health claims | 1-2 hours | A | Chronic Fatigue ICP: risk quantified; inform launch messaging boundaries |
| ~~5~~ | ~~Persona dialogue stress-test~~ | ~~1-2 hours~~ | ~~A~~ | **DONE** — ICP-2026-02-04-001: 8 rounds, 4 upgrades (proxy gap distinction, Weekend Warrior softened, Job 3 market size flagged, positioning-economics tension). Grade: B- → B |

### Cross-References

| Dependent File | How This Analysis Connects |
