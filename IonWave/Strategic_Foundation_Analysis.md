## SECTION 1: MAIN CONTENT

### 1.1 Thesis Reconciliation: ODD-1 vs Thesis Sheet

**The Conflict:**
- **ODD-1 (Sheet 4)** positions IonWave broadly: "$5B+ electrolyte market," "$100K MRR in 12 months," "premium D2C electrolyte supplement." The addressable market is the entire electrolyte category.
- **Thesis (Sheet 5)** positions IonWave narrowly: "room for a #2 player in premium marine plasma electrolytes at 10-15% below Seaonic." The addressable market is the marine plasma sub-segment specifically.

These are fundamentally different strategic bets. One says "we're entering the electrolyte market with a better product." The other says "we're entering a specific niche where one incumbent exists and we can be the credible alternative."

**Resolution — Evidence Supports Narrow Positioning (Thesis Sheet)**

Three independent analyses converge on the narrow thesis:

**1. Porter's Five Forces (v1.1.0):**
- Force 5 (Rivalry): 150+ brands in general electrolytes. Competing broadly is a losing game — IonWave has no brand equity, no distribution moat, and insufficient capital to outspend LMNT ($24M cash, est. $6M/yr ad spend).
- Force 4 (Substitutes): DIY electrolyte risk is highest for price-sensitive general market. Marine plasma's 78-mineral complexity is the strongest substitute defense.
- Persona Dialogue Upgrade: "Category creation" framing — marine plasma isn't an established consumer category. IonWave must create demand, not just capture it. This is a narrow-market problem, not a broad one.
- **Verdict: Broad positioning = death by competition. Narrow = defensible.** [Confidence: B | Source: Porter's Analysis v1.1.0]

**2. ICP Analysis (v1.0.0):**
- JTBD analysis found 4 market jobs. LMNT dominates Jobs 1-2 (Fasting, Workout Recovery). IonWave's strongest opening is Job 3 (Daily Wellness / Energy) — a job LMNT is weakly positioned for.
- Primary ICP is a biohacker/optimizer who has already tried LMNT. This is a niche audience, not a mass market.
- "Not the ICP" exclusions (general fitness casuals, price shoppers) explicitly reject the broad market.
- **Verdict: The customer base is narrow. Marketing to "the electrolyte market" wastes capital on audiences that won't convert.** [Confidence: B | Source: ICP Analysis v1.0.0]

**3. Thesis Sheet's Own Evidence:**
- Kill criteria are marine-plasma-specific (supplier COGS, Seaonic exclusivity, Meta CPM). These only make sense in a narrow context.
- Competitive reality check names 4 players: Seaonic (direct competitor), LMNT (category gorilla), Quinton (pharmaceutical positioning), Biocean/Actimar (supplier). This is a niche competitive set.
- Differentiation options: "Flavored options: STRONGEST" — this only works as differentiation within marine plasma (LMNT already has flavors; it's Seaonic and Quinton that don't).
- **Verdict: The Thesis sheet's own internal logic is narrow, even when ODD-1 frames it broadly.** [Confidence: A | Source: 01_Strategic_Foundation Thesis sheet]

### Reconciliation Verdict

| Dimension | ODD-1 (Broad) | Thesis (Narrow) | Evidence Winner |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Market framing | $5B electrolyte TAM | Marine plasma #2 behind Seaonic | **Narrow** — Porter's shows broad = 150+ rivals |
| Customer target | Premium D2C supplement buyers | Biohacker/optimizer who's tried LMNT | **Narrow** — ICP validates specific persona |
| Competitive set | Entire electrolyte category | Seaonic, Quinton, Biocean (+ LMNT as gorilla) | **Narrow** — only 1 direct competitor in marine plasma |
| Capital plan | $30-50K to reach $100K MRR | Not explicitly addressed | **Tension** — narrow is cheaper to execute but $100K MRR target may be unrealistic in marine plasma sub-segment |
| Differentiation | 78 minerals, ocean-sourced | Price arbitrage, purity, flavors | **Narrow** — differentiation options are sub-segment specific |

**Recommended Action:** Retain Thesis sheet as the canonical strategic thesis. Reclassify ODD-1 as "original pitch deck — superseded by validated thesis." Do NOT delete ODD-1 (it contains useful TAM/SAM/SOM estimates and the capital plan), but clearly label it as v0 thinking that has been refined.

**Critical assumption (from persona dialogue SF-2026-02-04-001):** The narrow thesis hinges on the marine plasma sub-segment being large enough to sustain a business. We have Seaonic's existence as evidence the sub-segment is real, but zero data on its SIZE. If the total marine plasma DTC market is <$1M, the 'room for #2' thesis fails regardless of positioning quality. The analysis should specify a **minimum viable sub-segment size** and validate it by estimating Seaonic's revenue from available signals (Trustpilot review volume, social media, ad activity).

### 1.2 Capital Tension Analysis

**The Problem:**
- ODD-1 requests $30-50K investment, targeting $100K MRR in 12 months.
- Porter's persona dialogue surfaced: Meta CPMs rising 27% YoY, zero switching costs in DTC electrolytes, and category creation (not just capture) costs make $30-50K potentially insufficient.

**Evidence Assessment:**

| Factor | ODD-1 Assumption | Porter's/ICP Reality | Gap |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-----|
| Customer acquisition | CAC <$40 | Meta CPMs rising 27% YoY; zero switching costs mean constant re-acquisition pressure | CAC may be higher and less stable than assumed |
| Market type | Capture existing demand | Marine plasma = category CREATION, not capture | Category creation costs 3-5x more than capture |
| Revenue target | $100K MRR in 12 months | Marine plasma DTC sachet segment ~$300K-$1.5M/yr; Seaonic ~$100-180K/yr (see Marine_Plasma_Market_Sizing.md) | $100K MRR ($1.2M ARR) = 4-8x the entire current segment. **Not achievable within marine plasma alone.** Must draw from broader $1.5B electrolyte market |
| Capital allocation | $10-15K ad spend | LMNT spends est. $6M/yr; even in narrow sub-segment, $10-15K may be below minimum viable spend | Need to validate minimum ad spend for measurable signal |
| Subscription model | >50% subscription rate, <8% churn | Zero switching costs; LMNT's 3.5-4% CVR sets benchmark but their churn is unknown | Subscription stickiness is unvalidated |

**Verdict:** The $30-50K capital plan is not automatically wrong, but it's under-validated. The Thesis sheet's kill criteria partially address this (Meta CPM >$20 = kill at Week 6; CVR <2% = kill at Week 6), which is good discipline. However, the kill criteria don't address the category creation cost gap — they assume demand exists to be captured.

**Recommendation:** Add a new kill criterion or assumption with a **specific, measurable definition** (sharpened by persona dialogue SF-2026-02-04-001): "If $5K in targeted ad spend generates <50 email opt-ins from a landing page explaining marine plasma electrolytes, the market may be too small or the category creation cost too high." This tests both interest (opt-in) and message-market fit (does the marine plasma story resonate?). Note: 'qualified leads' was too vague for a real kill criterion — email opt-ins from a purpose-built page is measurable and unambiguous.

### 1.3 Interview Insights Synthesis — Backfill from 03B VOC

The Interview Insights Synthesis sheet (Sheet 2) is a 100% empty template. We don't have IonWave customer interviews, but we do have 31 verified LMNT customer quotes at saturation (03B v1.0.1). These serve as proxy customer voice until IonWave-specific interviews are conducted.

**Note:** All data below is LMNT proxy data, not IonWave customer data. This is explicitly labeled as such in every section.

#### TOP PAIN POINTS (by frequency from LMNT VOC)

| Rank | Pain Point | Frequency (of 31) | Sample Quote | Implication for IonWave |
|------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Overwhelming saltiness / taste | 6 quotes (19.4%) | LMNT-001: "jarringly salty" | Product opportunity: marine plasma may have naturally better mineral balance; position as "all the electrolytes, none of the salt bomb" |
| 2 | High price ($500+/yr for daily use) | 3 quotes (9.7%) | LMNT-013: "over $500 a year just for an electrolyte drink" | Price positioning: 10-15% below Seaonic is thesis; ensure this also beats LMNT $/serving for daily users |
| 3 | Fasted nausea / stomach issues | 3 quotes (9.7%) | LMNT-030: "Mild nausea and stomach gurgling" on empty stomach | Product opportunity: test marine plasma tolerance on empty stomach; if better, this is a differentiator |
| 4 | Delivery/fulfillment failures | 2 quotes (6.5%) | LMNT-023: "35 days later and still nothing" | Operations: ensure fulfillment is reliable from Day 1; this is table stakes |

#### TOP JOBS TO BE DONE (from ICP JTBD Analysis)

| Rank | Job | When | Current Solution | IonWave Opportunity |
|------|-----|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Sustained daily energy without caffeine dependency | Morning routine, afternoon slump | LMNT (positioned for sport/fasting, not daily wellness) | **HIGHEST** — LMNT weakest here; marine plasma wellness story fits |
| 2 | Prevent keto flu / maintain electrolyte balance on restricted diet | Starting keto, ongoing maintenance | LMNT, DIY salt water, magnesium supplements | **HIGH** — strong VOC validation; keto community is accessible |
| 3 | Peak cognitive + physical performance throughout day | All day, especially during work | LMNT, various supplement stacks | **MODERATE** — competes with broad supplement market, not just electrolytes |
| 4 | Identity expression — "I optimize, therefore I am" | Social media, community, purchasing decisions | LMNT brand, Seaonic for marine purists | **MODERATE** — requires brand equity IonWave doesn't yet have |

#### SEGMENT INSIGHTS (from ICP Archetype Validation)

| Segment | # "Interviewed" (VOC proxy) | Key Insight | Willingness to Pay | Priority |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Keto/Carnivore | 7+ LMNT quotes | Strongest validated segment; keto flu relief is acute, recurring pain point; community-driven discovery | HIGH ($1.50-2.00/serving) | **1 — Primary** |
| Biohackers | 3-4 LMNT quotes | Exists and active (r/biohackers); demands evidence and "best-in-class" positioning; will research before buying | HIGH ($2.00+/serving) | **2 — Primary** |
| Endurance Athletes | 2-3 LMNT quotes | Performance improvement validated; high volume users (subscription-friendly); but competes in LMNT's strongest territory | MODERATE-HIGH ($1.50/serving) | **3 — Secondary** |
| Exhausted Professionals | 2-3 LMNT quotes | Energy/wellness job validated; highest IonWave opportunity per JTBD; but least "electrolyte-aware" segment | MODERATE ($1.00-1.50/serving) | **2 — Primary** (despite lower WTP, highest strategic opportunity) |
| General Health / Casual | 0 LMNT quotes specific | No validated evidence; highest price sensitivity; highest DIY substitute risk | LOW (<$1.00/serving) | **5 — Deprioritize** |

#### SURPRISING FINDINGS (from cross-analysis)

1. **LMNT's dominant pain point is taste (19.4% of VOC), not price.** Customers tolerate the price but actively complain about and work around the saltiness. IonWave's marine plasma may solve this naturally — 78 minerals at lower individual concentrations vs LMNT's 1000mg sodium bomb. [Confidence: B | Source: 03B VOC theme analysis]

2. **Customers are self-dosing at 50% of recommended amounts.** Multiple LMNT reviews mention using half-packets or diluting 2x beyond instructions. The market is telling the category: "too much sodium." A lower-sodium, mineral-diverse formulation maps directly to this unmet need. [Confidence: A | Source: LMNT-003, LMNT-018, LMNT-019]

3. **The daily wellness job is underserved by everyone.** LMNT positions for sport/fasting. Seaonic positions for purity/heritage. Quinton positions as pharmaceutical. Nobody owns "daily mineral wellness for busy professionals." [Confidence: B | Source: ICP JTBD analysis + Porter's Force 5 positioning gaps]

4. **LMNT's customer service is genuinely excellent** — even unhappy customers praise it (LMNT-021, LMNT-022). This raises the bar for IonWave; you can't win on service alone because LMNT already sets a high standard. [Confidence: A | Source: 03B VOC]

5. **The biohacker community treats premium electrolytes as identity products, not commodity health supplements.** This means brand and positioning matter more than price. The marine plasma origin story is a potential identity anchor. [Confidence: B | Source: LMNT-031, ICP Optimizer/Biohacker profile]

#### QUOTES FOR MARKETING (adapted from LMNT VOC — use as templates, NOT as IonWave quotes)

These are LMNT customer expressions that reveal the LANGUAGE and FRAMING IonWave's future customers will use. Use as copy inspiration, not direct quotes.

| # | Adapted Theme | Source Expression | IonWave Copy Angle |
|---|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Keto flu relief | "Killed my keto flu symptoms in one day" (LMNT-007) | "Your keto flu has a cure. 78 ocean minerals, zero compromises." |
| 2 | Morning energy | "The morning grogginess lifted faster" (LMNT-029) | "What if your morning water actually woke you up?" |
| 3 | Taste frustration | "jarringly salty" / "super salty sewage" (LMNT-001, LMNT-004) | "All the minerals. None of the salt bomb." |
| 4 | Price justification | "the health benefits and convenience make it worth every penny" (LMNT-014) | "78 minerals from the ocean. What's that worth to you?" |
| 5 | Self-dosing insight | "I typically use half packet" (LMNT-018) | "Balanced by nature. No half-measures needed." |

[Confidence for entire Interview Insights backfill: C+ | Source: 100% proxy data from LMNT VOC. Labeled as such. Must be replaced/validated with IonWave-specific customer data post-launch.]

### 1.4 Narrative Hypothesis Table — Evidence Fill

The Narrative Hypothesis Table (Sheet 3) has 6 narratives at "Testing" status with zero evidence. Below is the available evidence from our analyses.

| Narrative | Audience | Hypothesis | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Confidence | Status |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| "78 minerals vs just 3" | Customers | Differentiation drives purchase | Biohacker persona validated — demands "best-in-class" (ICP); LMNT-031 shows biohacker community values premium ingredients; taste data suggests LMNT's 3-mineral approach causes salt overload (6 taste complaints) | No direct evidence that customers understand or value mineral count specifically; "78 minerals" could confuse rather than persuade if not explained; no A/B test data | C+ | Testing — needs ad copy A/B test |
| "Ocean-sourced is better" | Customers | Natural positioning resonates | Keto/Carnivore dieter worldview: "ancestral/natural is better" (ICP); Quinton's 125-year pharmaceutical heritage demonstrates long-term credibility of marine plasma; LMNT maltodextrin lawsuits show market punishes "unnatural" ingredients | "Natural" is overused in supplements and increasingly scrutinized by FTC; marine plasma sourcing story requires education; no evidence this specific claim converts | C | Testing — needs landing page test |
| "Your body is 70% ocean" | Customers | Science angle builds trust | Optimizer/Biohacker demands research and data (ICP); positioned well for podcasts and long-form content; resonates with the "body as system" worldview | Claim is scientifically imprecise (body is ~60% water, not "ocean"); could be seen as pseudoscience by skeptical audiences; no evidence this framing outperforms simpler claims | C- | Testing — HIGH RISK narrative; needs scientific review before using |
| "$2M EBITDA in 24 months" | Operators | Financial outcome motivates | Standard DTC playbook; if unit economics validate (CAC <$40, LTV >$120, margin >65%), the math works on paper | Porter's capital tension: $30-50K raise may be insufficient; category creation costs not factored; $100K MRR ($1.2M ARR) may require >50% of marine plasma sub-segment; no comparable marine plasma DTC exit data | D | **UNDERMINED** — needs replacement. Persona dialogue proposed: "Profitable at $30K MRR within 12 months in the marine plasma sub-segment" as a more honest target aligned with narrow thesis + limited capital |
| "<10 hrs/week after Month 4" | Operators | Lifestyle outcome motivates | DTC automation is mature (Shopify, Klaviyo, Meta ads); subscription model reduces fulfillment complexity after setup | Ignores category creation work (content, community, education) which is labor-intensive and ongoing; customer service during growth phase is unpredictable | C- | Testing — plausible for operations but not for growth/marketing |
| "Copy excellence, execute cleaner" | Team | Methodology creates alignment | Porter's analysis confirms LMNT has proven the playbook; IonWave can learn from LMNT's strengths (customer service, community, positioning) and avoid weaknesses (taste, maltodextrin controversy) | "Copying" as a narrative is uninspiring for team building; doesn't address what's genuinely novel about IonWave's approach; marine plasma IS the novel element, not the execution method | C | Testing — true as strategy but weak as narrative; reframe around marine plasma innovation |

[Confidence for evidence fills: C overall | Source: Porter's v1.1.0, ICP Analysis v1.0.0, 03B VOC. No A/B test or real-world performance data exists yet.]

### 1.5 Assumptions Register — Capital Tension Flag

**Existing assumptions with updated assessment:**

| Assumption | Current Value | Original Confidence | Updated Confidence | Evidence Update |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| CAC | <$40 | Medium | **Medium-Low** | Porter's: Meta CPMs rising 27% YoY; zero switching costs = continuous re-acquisition; category creation (not capture) inflates CAC. Kill criterion at Week 6 is good discipline. |
| LTV | >$120 | Low | **Low** | No new evidence. Depends on churn assumption below. Porter's: zero switching costs suggest LTV is fragile. |
| Subscription rate | >50% | Medium | **Medium** | No new evidence. ICP Analysis: Keto/Carnivore and Biohacker segments are subscription-friendly (identity-driven, daily use). Exhausted Professional is convenience-driven = also subscription-friendly. |
| Monthly churn | <8% | Low | **Low-Medium** | ICP JTBD analysis suggests job stickiness varies: Keto (HIGH — recurring need), Wellness (MODERATE — habitual), Identity (LOW — switches with trends). No comparable marine plasma churn data exists. |
| Gross margin | >65% | High | **Medium-High** | Porter's: supplier concentration risk (Actimar/Biocean oligopoly) could compress margins; alternative suppliers not yet validated. CRITICAL: supplier COGS must be validated Week 1 per kill criteria. |

**New assumption recommended:**

| Assumption | Value | Confidence | Validation Method |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Addressable demand exists at current awareness | >50 qualified leads from $5K ad spend | Low | Initial ad test targeting marine plasma / premium electrolyte keywords |

[Confidence: B for the assessment | Source: Porter's capital tension analysis + ICP JTBD analysis]

## SECTION 2: INTELLIGENCE GAPS

### Gap 1: No Financial Model Linked to Thesis
**What's Missing:** The Assumptions Register has 5 assumptions (CAC, LTV, subscription rate, churn, margin) but no financial model connecting them to revenue projections. ODD-1 claims $100K MRR in 12 months but doesn't show the math.
**Current Confidence:** D
**Impact:** Cannot validate whether $30-50K capital is sufficient, whether $100K MRR is achievable in the marine plasma sub-segment, or whether the kill criteria thresholds are appropriately set.
**How to Fill:** Build or audit 08_Financial_Model.xlsx with scenarios: optimistic, base, pessimistic. Link assumptions directly. [Track A — 2-4 hours if model exists; 6-8 hours to build from scratch]
**Priority:** **CRITICAL** — the capital tension cannot be resolved without this.

### Gap 2: No IonWave Customer Data
**What's Missing:** Interview Insights are 100% LMNT proxy. The backfill above is useful but fundamentally second-hand.
**Current Confidence:** C (proxy backfill) vs D (for IonWave-specific insights)
**Impact:** Every customer-facing decision (messaging, positioning, pricing, creative) is built on LMNT customer proxies, not IonWave customer validation.
**How to Fill:** Conduct 5-10 exploratory interviews with marine plasma users (Seaonic customers, Quinton users, Biocean community). [Track A: find + outreach | Track B: conduct interviews]
**Priority:** **HIGH** — pre-launch, not blocking for initial tests, but blocking for confident scaling.

### Gap 3: "Right to Win" is Assertion-Only
**What's Missing:** ODD-1 Sheet 4 claims "operational excellence, speed, capital efficiency, differentiated product, community access" as the Right to Win, but provides no evidence for any of these.
**Current Confidence:** D
**Impact:** Investors and team members will challenge every bullet point. "Operational excellence" for a company that hasn't shipped yet is a claim, not a credential.
**Persona dialogue reframe (SF-2026-02-04-001):** IonWave's current Right to Win is **singular: the marine plasma positioning itself** combined with the narrow thesis and kill-criteria discipline. All other claims (operational excellence, speed, capital efficiency, community access) are aspirational until demonstrated. This is honest, not negative — acknowledging it builds investor credibility rather than undermining it.
**How to Fill:** (a) Document Caio's relevant past experience/track record. (b) Identify 1-2 proof points for each Right to Win claim. (c) Reframe: lead with marine plasma positioning as the primary Right to Win, present others as execution capabilities to be demonstrated. [Track A: draft | Track B: Caio provides personal credentials]
**Priority:** **MEDIUM** — important for fundraising but not blocking for product launch.

### Gap 4: Narrative Hypotheses Untested
**What's Missing:** All 6 narratives are at "Testing" status but no tests have been run. Evidence has been filled from analysis, but no real-world performance data exists.
**Current Confidence:** C (evidence-informed) vs D (for actual conversion data)
**Impact:** Marketing copy and positioning will be based on logical inference, not empirical validation. High risk of wasting early ad spend on narratives that don't convert.
**How to Fill:** (a) Design 3-4 ad copy variants mapping to top narratives. (b) Run $500-1000 Meta ad test targeting primary ICP. (c) Measure CTR and landing page CVR per narrative. [Track B — requires ad spend and setup]
**Priority:** **MEDIUM** — becomes HIGH once ad testing begins.

### Gap 5: Marine Plasma Sub-Segment Size — PARTIALLY FILLED
**What Was Missing:** The narrow thesis assumes the marine plasma DTC sub-segment is large enough to sustain a business. Seaonic's existence proves the segment is real, but we had zero data on its size.
**Resolution:** See `Marine_Plasma_Market_Sizing.md` v1.0.0 — five-signal revenue triangulation estimates Seaonic at ~$100-180K/year. Total marine plasma DTC sachet segment (US) estimated at $300K-$1.5M/year.
**Updated Confidence:** D → **C+**
**Key Finding:** The marine plasma DTC segment alone is too small to sustain a business at ODD-1's $100K MRR target. But IonWave's real addressable market is the intersection of marine plasma positioning + the $1.5B US electrolyte sachet market. Marine plasma is the *differentiation tool*, not the *market definition*.
**Remaining Gaps:** Seaonic growth trajectory unknown; QuintEssential sachet revenue share unknown; Buoy (adjacent competitor) revenue unknown.
**Priority:** ~~HIGH~~ **RESOLVED at C+ confidence** — monitoring gaps remain but the thesis question is answered.

### Gap 6: Thesis Reconciliation Not Yet Formalized in Spreadsheet
**What's Missing:** This analysis recommends retaining Thesis sheet as canonical and reclassifying ODD-1 as superseded, but this hasn't been executed in the xlsx yet.
**Current Confidence:** N/A — this is a process gap, not an evidence gap
**Impact:** Future sessions may re-encounter the conflicting theses and waste time re-analyzing.
**How to Fill:** Add a "Thesis Status" or header note to ODD-1 sheet: "v0 — superseded by Thesis sheet. Retained for TAM/SAM/SOM estimates and capital plan reference." [Track A — 5 minutes]
**Priority:** **LOW** — quick fix, should be done now.

---

## SECTION 3: SCORECARD

### Confidence Overview

| Component | Before | After | Key Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Thesis clarity | ~4.5/10 (conflicting) | ~6.5/10 (reconciled, narrow validated, sub-segment sized) | Evidence from Porter's + ICP converges on narrow positioning; sub-segment sized via Marine_Plasma_Market_Sizing.md (C+ confidence) |
| Interview Insights | ~1/10 (empty) | ~4/10 (proxy-filled) | 03B VOC backfilled; explicitly labeled as LMNT proxy |
| Narrative Hypotheses | ~3/10 (framework only) | ~4.5/10 (evidence-informed) | 6 narratives now have evidence for/against + updated confidence |
| Assumptions Register | ~5/10 (clean but unvalidated) | ~5.5/10 (tension-flagged) | Capital tension flagged; new assumption recommended |
| ODD-1 Thesis | ~4-5/10 (unreflective) | ~5/10 (classified as v0) | Explicitly positioned as superseded; still useful for TAM/capital reference |
| **Overall** | **~4.5/10** | **~6.5/10** | Evidence integrated; contradictions resolved; gaps flagged; persona dialogue stress-tested (5 upgrades applied); sub-segment sized (Gap 5 partially filled) |

### Top Strategic Implications

1. **The narrow thesis is the strongest *hypothesis* — treat as the working thesis, not a validated conclusion.** Evidence from Porter's, ICP, and internal analysis converges on narrow positioning, but the underlying sub-segment size is unvalidated (D confidence). All downstream decisions (product, positioning, customer) should be framed as testable bets, not confirmed strategy. (Upgraded by persona dialogue SF-2026-02-04-001)

2. **The capital plan needs stress-testing against a financial model.** The $30-50K may work for the narrow thesis (lower ad spend, smaller initial market) but the category creation costs and rising CPMs create real risk. Kill criteria are good but don't test market existence.

3. **Interview Insights now have usable proxy data, but the "proxy" label is critical.** Every downstream decision that touches customer insight (messaging, creative, offer structure) should flag whether it's based on LMNT proxy or IonWave primary data.
