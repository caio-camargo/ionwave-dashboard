# 01 — SCOPING CHECKPOINT
**Two variants: PRE-WORK (at start) and SURPRISE (mid-research)**

---

## VARIANT A: PRE-WORK SCOPING

Run this before beginning research on a new competitor. These questions prevent wasted work.

### Core Questions (always ask)

1. **Who is the competitor?** (Name + one sentence on what they do)

2. **What tier are they?** (Tier 1 = direct, Tier 2 = adjacent, Tier 3 = peripheral)
   - If unsure, default to Tier 1 and adjust after scoping

3. **What's the primary strategic question this analysis needs to answer?**
   - Example: "Can IonWave defend its positioning against this competitor?"
   - Example: "Is this competitor a threat we should monitor or respond to?"
   - This determines depth and focus

4. **Is there anything you already know about this competitor that I should factor in?**
   - Prior research, insider knowledge, rumors, recent news

5. **Are there specific metrics or claims that are most critical to verify?**
   - Example: "Their revenue estimate — I've seen wildly different numbers"
   - Example: "Their pricing structure — I need to know subscription vs. one-time"

### Conditional Questions (ask if relevant)

6. **Have we analyzed this competitor before?** If yes: what changed, what needs refreshing?

7. **Is this for a specific deliverable or audience?** (Investor deck vs. internal strategy vs. quick assessment)

8. **Any competitors we should compare this one against in the output?**

### Decision After Scoping
- If Tier 1: run full protocol (all phases)
- If Tier 2: can skip persona dialogue, lighter benchmark check
- If Tier 3: research phase only, quick profile output

---

## VARIANT B: SURPRISE CHECKPOINT

Run this when something unexpected surfaces mid-research. This is NOT a full scoping reset — it's a focused "what do we do with this?" moment.

### Trigger Conditions
A surprise checkpoint fires when ANY of these occur:
- A finding contradicts a prior assumption by >50% (e.g., revenue 3x higher than expected)
- A competitor turns out to be in a completely different category than assumed
- A data source reveals information about a DIFFERENT competitor that's strategically relevant
- Customer voice reveals a pain point or preference that challenges IonWave's core thesis
- A competitor appears to be doing something that closes IonWave's defensibility window

### Questions to Ask

1. **Here's what I found: [state the surprise clearly in 2-3 sentences]**
   **Does this change the strategic question we're trying to answer?**

2. **Should I adjust the analysis focus based on this, or continue as planned?**

3. **Is there additional context you have that explains this finding?**
   - (Sometimes what looks like a surprise to Claude is expected to the human)

4. **Do you want me to flag this as a separate strategic note in the output, or integrate it into the main analysis?**

### Decision After Surprise Checkpoint
- If human says "continue as planned" → resume RESEARCH, note the finding for output
- If human says "adjust focus" → update state tracker, re-route as needed
- If human says "this changes everything" → pause, discuss scope change, then resume

## CHECKPOINT LOGGING

After each checkpoint, log to state tracker:
```
CHECKPOINT: [A or B]
QUESTIONS_ASKED: [number]
KEY_DECISIONS: [brief summary of what was decided]
TIMESTAMP: [when]
```

This creates an audit trail of why the analysis went the direction it did.
